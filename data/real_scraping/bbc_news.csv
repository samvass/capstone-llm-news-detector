Why quitting heroin substitute methadone is 'vital',"The heroin substitute methadone can be used as a way of weaning addicts off heroin but the substitute can also become addictive.Earlier this year a debate broke out in Scotland when Professor Neil McKeganey, director of the Centre for Drug Misuse Research at the University of Glasgow, said more effort was needed to get people off drugs, including methadone, through abstinence. But a group of 40 specialists, including university professors and doctors who treat addicts, responded: ""If policy makers were to heed the critics' advice to close down methadone treatment or impose an arbitrary time limit on its administration, the community can anticipate more overdose deaths, more HIV and more crime."" So what do recovering addicts think? Chris used methadone for five years to help wean him off heroin but felt he had to quit the drug substitute last October""I just thought, I've got to get a grip here, because I've been in and out of prison since I was 16 - that's half my life,"" he told The Report.  Chris,  an inmate of HMP Edinburgh, lives in Ratho Hall, a specialist Addiction Support Area that helps prisoners achieve abstinence.  ""I heard about Ratho Hall, and it's given me the wake-up call that I needed,"" he said.  Chris was prescribed methadone, a synthetic opiate that is taken orally, to wean him off his heroin addiction but although methadone can help addicts stabilise their lives, it is also addictive.         Ratho Hall is the only facility of its kind in Scotland.  It opened last year in brand new accommodation.  Of the 30 inmates resident last week, 11 have become completely drug-free.  The Scottish government produced its strategy document on drugs, The Road to Recovery, in 2008.  In this, the Community Safety Minister, Fergus Ewing of the SNP, explained how he wants to see ""a new vision"" for Scotland ""where all drug treatment and rehabilitation services are based on the principle of recovery."" This is a shift away from an acceptance that people will stay on methadone for lengthy periods of time unchallenged.  Chris, who started to use heroin when he was 18, talked of his own addiction: ""When you're on heroin or methadone your head's hazy.  I realised when I was on methadone that I was just putting my life on hold.  ""Now I feel that abstinence is a walk in the park compared to taking drugs.  When you're abstinent you can just be yourself - it's a weight off your shoulders.""Chris said he could not have done it on his own.  In Ratho Hall, there are drug counsellors, regular peer-support meetings and medical staff.  Paul Davidson, unit manager of Ratho Hall, explained how the unit works.  ""If guys come in here on a methadone prescription, they have to have a reduction plan.  ""So they'll be reduced at a rate they feel comfortable with and the doctor feels is right for them.""  Around one in five prisoners in Scotland is being prescribed methadone.  But across the whole of Scotland it is estimated that 22,000 people are taking methadone.  Some of them may have been on it for decades.  In England more than 150,000 people are receiving a substitute drug treatment for their addiction, normally methadone.  Maxie Richards, a committed Christian has been helping addicts get clean since 1986, and is a firm believer in abstinence.  Her suburban Glasgow home is an unlikely venue for drug rehabilitation. ""The majority of those I see now want to come off methadone.  And it's harder to come off than heroin, it's so sad.  ""It's also a very debilitating drug too, and can lead to memory loss,"" she explained.James Boyd, one of the addicts who came to Maxie Richards for help, looks fit and well, but when he arrived on her doorstep in June, he was three stone lighter.""I thought death would be better than the way I was feeling.  What methadone does to you is wrecks you physically, mentally and spiritually.  ""I said to myself, I can't do this any more.  Every single person I know is on heroin and they are all on methadone too.""James stopped methadone and all other drugs nearly two months ago.  He thinks he has got over the withdrawal symptoms now.""It's just two weeks ago that I had my first full night's sleep.""Another former addict - Gail - is looking forward to a drug-free life.  She is slowly reducing her methadone dose with the support of her doctor.  Gail has been taking methadone for eight years.  ""A lot of addicts use methadone as a backup plan - so when you can't get hold of any drugs, you've got something to hold you.  ""I was taking heroin on top of my methadone.  Then I took half of it and used to sell the rest, which I know is wrong.""  Eighteen months ago, Gail started to take methadone as it was prescribed.""When I stopped injecting and started to take my full prescription, that's when I started to feel the benefit of methadone.  ""I could get up in the morning, do the housework, and attend the appointments I'd made.  For the first time in many years, Gail is planning for her future with the help of the charity Centrepoint in Edinburgh.  She wants to go into a drug rehabilitation centre to make sure she overcomes her addiction once and for all.  Then she aims to find a job.  And it is her methadone prescription that is keeping her away from heroin.   ",Why quitting heroin substitute methadone is 'vital',0
North Korea leader's eldest son 'opposes dynasty',"The eldest son of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il says he opposes a dynastic succession that would see his younger half-brother take power.Kim Jong-un, the youngest son, has been unveiled as the nation's heir apparent, appearing alongside his father at a series of recent high-profile events.His elder brother, Kim Jong-nam, 39, lives overseas in China and Macau.His comments are highly unusual in the secretive North. But he is not thought to have influence inside the country.He was once thought to be his father's likely successor, but fell out of favour when he was caught trying to sneak into Japan in 2001 using a false passport. ""Personally, I am against third-generation dynastic succession,"" Kim Jong-nam was quoted as saying by Japanese TV station Asahi.""But I think there were internal factors. I think we should adhere to it if there were internal factors involved.""He added that, ""For my part, I am prepared to help my younger brother whenever necessary while I stay abroad.""Kim Jong-nam lives in China and in the gaming resort of Macau, near Hong Kong. Although a member of the ruling family, he is thought to be no longer part of the inner circle that runs the country.  In a rare interview last year in China, he said he had ""no interest"" in taking power.North Korea's ailing leader Kim Jong-il took over the reins of the country after the death of his father Kim Il-sung in 1994.In recent weeks he appears to have designated his youngest son Kim Jong-un his successor.The youngest Kim, who is thought to be about 27, was made a four-star general and promoted to a key position in the ruling Workers' Party last month.He was unveiled to an invited audience of the world's media last weekend during celebrations to mark the 65th anniversary of the ruling party.He would take the Kim dynasty rule over the nation of 24 million into a third generation.He would also inherit a weighty legacy. North Korea is locked in a dispute with the West over its nuclear weapons programme and is struggling to revive its crumbling economy.",North Korea leader's eldest son 'opposes dynasty',0
Paintings by gangster Reggie Kray go on sale in Lincoln,"Seven oil paintings created by notorious gangster Reggie Kray while in prison are being auctioned in Lincoln.The pictures were painted by Kray during art classes attended by him and his brother Ronnie at Parkhurst Prison on the Isle of Wight in the 1970s.A portrait of the Krays by serial poisoner Graham Young will also go under the hammer. The Krays ran a notorious gang in London's East End known as The Firm during the 1950s and 1960s. They were jailed in 1969 for a recommended 30 years - Ronnie for shooting George Cornell in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel and Reggie for stabbing Jack ""The Hat"" McVitie in a North London flat.Auctioneer John Leatt from Thomas Mawer and Son said: ""Whilst not of great artistic merit, these will be popular with collectors of Kray and gangster memorabilia.""We anticipate a great deal of interest in these paintings on sale day and estimate they will fetch between £200 and £300 each.""Young, known as the 'Teacup Poisoner', was fascinated by poisons from a young age. At just 14 in 1962, he laced his step-mother Mollie's food with two poisons - antimony and digitalis - causing her death.After spending nine years in Broadmoor, he was released and went to work in a photographic studio where he had access to dangerous chemicals. Soon after, two colleagues fell ill and died after he spiked their tea with poison. He went on to make 70 others ill before being caught in 1972 and sent to Parkhurst.The sale is taking place on 5 and 6 November.",Paintings by gangster Reggie Kray go on sale in Lincoln,0
Bracklinn Falls Bridge hauled over gorge by hand,"A 20-tonne bridge is being hauled into place by hand because its remote location makes it impossible to use a crane.The new bridge across Bracklinn Falls, near Callander, is expected to be fully in place by Sunday.The wood and copper structure had to be built on site as the thick woodland also meant helicopters could not be used in the construction.The original steel bridge was washed away by floods in August 2004.Very heavy rain in that month also destroyed bridges in nearby Braeleny and Edinample, near Lochearnhead.Kenny Auld, from Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, said building the £110,000 bridge had been an ""exceptionally difficult task"".""It's a 20m span across a very deep gorge,"" he said.""For the last six years the community and the national park have been trying to get a replacement in place.""I've taken three batches of Royal Engineers to the site and they've just laughed in my face and told me I'm crazy.""The national park had to build a small access road to the site to transport materials, but it is only accessible to four-wheel drives or quad bikes.Engineers from Crief-based Strong Bridges built temporary steel rails across the gorge and mounted the bridge on skids so it could be pulled across.""There's a hand winch on the other side with one or two people winching the 20 tonne bridge across,"" said Mr Auld, who is managing the project for the national park.The bridge is made from Douglas firs from the Heritage Plantation in Dunkeld and has a copper roof.When in place, it will give an ""iconic view"" of the falls, Mr Auld said.The project has been funded by the national park, the Forth Valley and Lomond Leader and Scottish Natural Heritage and was built in partnership with Callander Community Development Trust.The trust's John Snodin said people in Callander had lobbied for a new bridge ever since the old one was washed away six years ago.""Both locals and tourists visit the site daily and the new bridge will be a destination in itself as well as a position to view the cataracts, which are impressive.""The bridge is only a short distance from the car park but it can also be utilised to create a series of longer circuits in the Callander area."" It will be officially opened in November after landscaping and footpath work has been completed.",Bracklinn Falls Bridge hauled over gorge by hand,0
Manchester soldier's last words become song,"The final words written by a guardsman killed in Afghanistan will be released as a single by chart act The Soldiers.Guardsman Neil Downes, known as Tony, from Manchester, died in an explosion in Helmand province in 2007.Two letters to his family and girlfriend Jane - written to be opened in the event of his death - were adapted for the song Letters Home.Ronnie Downes, his father, described the track as an ""absolutely fantastic"" tribute to the 20-year-old.It is common practice for serving soldiers to compose a last letter to loved ones, to be opened in the event of their death.The family of Guardsman Downes gave its blessing to production duo Nick Patrick and Jeff Chegwin to use his words.The song includes the lyrics ""I'm sorry to put you through all this, I'm sorry there was no last kiss"" and ""I'm up here in heaven, you're free to start again. My love will never end. I'm sorry to my family and friends"".Guardsman Downes' family welcomed The Soldiers to their pub - The Kings Head in Droylsden - on Wednesday to perform the song.Describing the tribute, Mr Downes said: ""How emotional. How proud. What a testament to him.""It was absolutely fantastic. I'm sure other people when they hear it will feel the same. What a tribute to a lovely lad.""There's so many emotions go through you.

Spiritual guardian of Indonesian volcano dies,"Even after an eruption alert was issued and most villagers on the slopes of Java's Mount Merapi had been evacuated, 83-year old Mbah (grandfather) Maridjan stayed put. The spiritual ""guardian"" of the mountain, his battle to tame one of Indonesia's most active volcanoes ended on Wednesday when he was buried by the mountain's thick ash.He was reportedly found dead in a prayer position in his house, as rescuers also dug out more than two dozen more victims in the area - many who had also refused to leave.In the wake of the eruption, houses and fields were left blanketed in thick, white ash, while leaves had been singed off trees.Villagers say they will mourn the loss of a respected elder who was as important to them as the mountain itself. The mountain is seen as sacred in the region, seen as the home of ancient Javanese spirits.Located on the outskirts of the city of Yogyakarta on Java Island, it regularly causes small eruptions in the area.For years Maridjan had led ceremonies at the volcano, dispersing rice or flowers in or around the crater in an effort to appease spirits. Maridjan believed he had a duty to the late sultan of Yogyakarta, Hamengkubuwono IX, who had appointed him for this purpose.If there were to be an eruption, many villagers believed Maridjan would be warned in a vision. Local beliefs are a mix of Islam, Indonesia's most predominant religion, and those dating from the island's Hindu-Buddhist period.One tradition is the annual Labuhan ceremony, an auspicious event where the palace makes offerings to spirits, including the Goddess of the South Sea, Kanjeng Ratu Kidul.It was Marijan who helped ensure such rituals were upheld.It is not the first time the old man had defied warnings from the authorities about the volcano. In 2006, when Mt Merapi last erupted, Maridjan even went closer to the crater, to meditate.  At the time, he told one journalist: ""I'm not afraid because it's my duty.""I'm like a soldier - they are never scared,"" he added. Perhaps it came as less of a surprise then, when this time, despite government warnings, Mbah Maridjan decided that it was important to stay.One rescue worker said that Maridjan was adamant in his refusal to leave his home village of Kinahrejo, just 5km (three miles) from the crater.""I'm so used to being at home, it's better for me to just stay here and pray,"" Maridjan reportedly told him.A journalist meanwhile perished trying to warn the old man to leave, according to local reports.Maridjan was not the only one who could not bring themselves to leave, and rescuers say they fear the death toll may rise.""I keep thinking about what's happening up there, with my cows, my property,"" said Hadi Sumarmo, who has a farm in Srumbung, a village 5km from the crater's mouth. ""I just want to go back to check. If I hear sirens, I'll get out again quickly.""For many survivors, the region will not be the same without their spiritual protector.""To us, Maridjan is as important as Merapi. Now that he's no longer around, who's going to look after Merapi?"" Wanto, 56, a farmer, told AFP news agency.""What happens if there's another eruption?""But, according to the Jakarta Globe, it was not a shock to the Yogyakarta palace, who had been warned of Maridjan's fate from a premonition.""We had known long before it happened that Mbah Maridjan would be taken by Merapi,"" the newspaper quoted Gusti Prabukusumo, the brother of the current sultan, as saying.""Now that he's gone, we have to choose a new gatekeeper soon.""",Spiritual guardian of Indonesian volcano dies,0
Paralysed trampoline teacher back at school,"An Aberdeenshire teacher who was paralysed from the shoulders down in a trampoline accident has returned to school to take classes.David Henderson, 36, fell while demonstrating exercises at the Gordon Schools in Huntly in 2007.He had now returned, one day a week initially, in his motorised wheelchair.Mr Henderson has also founded a church in a bid to stay positive in the wake of his ordeal, and help others at the same time.The maths teacher had been showing pupils some trampoline manoeuvres in October 2007 when he over rotated, landed on his shoulders, rolled off, and could not feel his legs.He received seven months of treatment in hospital before returning home.He told BBC Scotland: ""I have started lunchtime classes.""That's going to continue, one day a week, and then up to two, to see how much I can cope with.""He has also started a church in Huntly, of which he is pastor, and he explained: ""The church allows me to make a difference.""My mind is into what I can do for others.""Pupils received counselling after the incident.",Paralysed trampoline teacher back at school,0
'Never too old for a sexual infection',"Think of someone with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) and the chances are you will visualise someone young, the age group that is traditionally targetted in awareness campaigns.But in this week's Scrubbing Up, Linda Bailey from the Royal College of Nursing warns STI's are a growing problem for the over 40s, and that the problem is being ignored. Barely a month goes by without new warnings that the rate of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) is rising among the nation's youth.  Chlamydia, syphilis, gonorrhoea, herpes, and genital warts to name just a few are affecting ever-growing numbers with each year that passes. The effects of these infections can range from mild embarrassment through to life-long infertility or in the most serious of cases, premature death.We all know that young people have sex, and unfortunately protection is not always used. Because of this, there is now a plethora of social marketing and advertising campaigns warning teenagers and young adults of the dangers of unprotected sex.But what about the 'older' adults? Do we not count because people assume we no longer have sex? Or is it that being over the age of 40 somehow provides instant immunity to sexually transmitted infections?The truth is times have changed and so has the rate of STIs among older adults. Between 1999 and 2008 the Health Protection Agency reported a 53% increase in gonorrhoea among men aged 45-64 and a 93% increase among women. At the same time, the rate of herpes increased by 130% among this age group. Worryingly, there were also 17,000 new HIV diagnoses.While the incidence of STIs among older adults may be small compared with teenagers and young adults, it is there and it is growing.Sexual freedomThere are an increasing number of people in their 40s, 50s and 60s who are newly single having recently come to the end of a long-term relationship. Many of these people would have also been in secure, stable relationships during the 1980s and impassive to the powerful advertising campaigns that shocked their single friends into protecting themselves from the scourge of HIV and AIDS. Many of these now 'older' adults will have had their first sexual experiences in the relatively safe years before we realised the dawn of Aids was just around the corner. The pill was easily accessible and as teenagers and young people, this generation, felt free to experiment. This group is now once again revelling in sexual freedom, but without the benefit of having ever been the target of public health campaigns to warn them of the dangers. The truth is that infections do not discriminate between 18 or 80 year olds - we all need to be careful.The Department of Health website provides an array of sexual health guidance and leaflets for prisoners, drug users, young men, young women, gay and bi-sexual men, people from black and ethnic communities and sex workers. These people all have needs and their needs are very important. However there is a huge gap in information aimed at people like myself who are single, straight, of a certain age and sexually active. It appears that sex in the over-40s just doesn't happen, or if it does it isn't talked about. There are many excellent campaigns out there to alert the nation's youth to the dangers of unprotected sex. But unfortunately cartoon characters and street slang just don't speak to people like me. Times have changed and sex no longer belongs to the younger generation. We should be embracing the fact 40, 50, 60 and beyond is no longer ""past-it"" and celebrate the young and active lifestyles of the older community. However, to keep the sexually liberated over-40s infection-free, which will also ultimately save the NHS money, we need a dedicated awareness campaign which sends out the right messages through the right channels to the right people.Health advice for the over-40s: Your Comments",'Never too old for a sexual infection',0
PE teacher dies surfing off Perranporth beach,"A 31-year-old PE teacher from Cornwall has died while surfing off Perranporth.Matt Upsher, from Perranporth and who had epilepsy, was surfing on Monday night with his brother.

The head teacher at Hayle Community School, where Mr Upsher worked, has paid tribute to him. Falmouth coastguard was alerted and a St Agnes lifeboat and RNAS Culdrose rescue helicopter were launched after Mr Upsher was found at about 2000 BST on Monday.An off-duty doctor who was in the area at the time gave Mr Upsher CPR before he was airlifted to hospital, coastguards said.Head teacher Chris Jackman said Mr Upsher joined Hayle School in September 2001 as a newly qualified teacher, became head of PE in 2004 and was a ""much valued colleague"".

Pupils often commented on how much they had learned from Matt.""We will miss him deeply and our thoughts are with his family and loved ones.""Flowers and tributes have been laid at the beach.",PE teacher dies surfing off Perranporth beach,0
Tobin drops Vicky Hamilton sentence appeal,"Scottish serial killer Peter Tobin has dropped his appeal against his life sentence for murdering schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton.Tobin, 63, who is serving life for murdering three young women, had been challenging his 30-year sentence for killing the Falkirk teenager in 1991.Ms Hamilton, 15, was abducted in Bathgate in West Lothian.Her remains were found 17 years later buried in the garden of Tobin's former home in Margate, Kent.Judge Lord Emslie branded Tobin ""unfit to live in a decent society"" following his conviction at the High Court in Dundee in December 2008.He was given a life sentence and ordered to serve at least 30 years. The appeal at the High Court in Edinburgh centred on Tobin's claim that the sentence was excessive.A hearing relating to the appeal was due to take place on Friday this week.But the Scottish Court Service has now confirmed a Minute of Abandonment had been received and the appeal would not continue.The minute would have been submitted by Tobin's counsel on his behalf.In August, Ms Hamilton's father Michael, and Ian McNicol, whose 18-year-old daughter Dinah was also murdered by Tobin, called for him to be denied the right to a court appeal.The call was made after Tobin failed to turn up at the Court of Appeal in Edinburgh twice through illness.Mr Hamilton said at the time it was ""ridiculous"" that taxpayers' money was being spent on the appeal when the killer would spend the rest of his days in jail.Mr McNicol described the appeal as ""a farce"" and said Tobin was ""a chancer"".Tobin, from Johnstone in Renfrewshire, is serving another two life sentences for the murders of Polish student Angelika Kluk and Ms McNicol.He raped and killed Ms Kluk, 23, at a Glasgow church in September 2006.Ms McNicol vanished in August 1991 while hitchhiking to her home in Tillingham after leaving a music festival in Liphook, Hampshire. Her remains were found alongside those of Ms Hamilton.",Tobin drops Vicky Hamilton sentence appeal,0
"Love can ease pain, say brain researchers","Love hurts, at least according to many a romantic songwriter, but it may also help ease pain, US scientists suggest.Brain scans suggest many of the areas normally involved in pain response are also activated by amorous thoughts.Stanford University researchers gave 15 students mild doses of pain, while checking if they were distracted by gazing at photos of their beloved.The study focused on people early in a romance, journal PLoS One reported, so the ""drug of love"" may wear off.The scientists who carried out the experiment used ""functional magnetic resonance imaging"" (fMRI) to measure activity in real-time in different parts of the brain.It has been known for some time that strong feelings of love are linked to intense activity in several different brain regions.These include areas linked to the brain chemical dopamine, which produces the brain's feel-good state following certain stimulants - from eating sweets to taking cocaine.The Stanford University researchers had noticed that when we feel pain, some of the same areas ""light up"" on the scans - and wondered whether one might affect the other.They recruited a dozen students who were all in the first nine months of a relationship, defined as ""the first phase of intense love"".Each was asked to bring in a picture of the object of their affection and photos of what they deemed an equally attractive acquaintance.While their brains were scanned, they were shown these pictures, while a computer controlled heat pad placed in the palm of their hand was set up to cause them mild pain.They found that viewing the picture of their beloved reduced perceptions of pain much more than looking at the image of the acquaintance.Dr Jarred Younger, one of the researchers involved, said that the ""love-induced analgesia"" appeared to involve more primitive functions of the brain, working in a similar way to opioid painkillers.""One of the key sites is the nucleus accumbens, a key reward addiction centre for opioids, cocaine and other drugs of abuse.""The region tells the brain that you really need to keep doing this.""Professor Paul Gilbert, a neuropsychologist from the University of Derby, said that the relationship between emotional states and the perception of pain was clear.He said: ""One example is a footballer who has suffered quite a painful injury, but who is able to continue playing because of his emotionally charged state.""He added that while the effect noticed by the Stanford researchers might only be short-lived in the early stages of a love affair, it may well be replaced by something similar later in a relationship, with a sense of comfort and wellbeing generating the release of endorphins.""It's important to recognise that people who feel alone and depressed may have very low pain thresholds, whereas the reverse can be true for people who feel secure and cared for.""This may well be an issue for the health service, as patients are sometimes rushed through the system, and perhaps there isn't this focus on caring that might have existed once.""","Love can ease pain, say brain researchers",0
Travelling the smugglers' route from Turkey to Iran,"This is the image greeting travellers at the border. Behind the barbed wire snaking up the hillside, the huge portraits of Ayatollahs Khomeini and Khamenei dominate the valley.   This is the border between Iran and Turkey. The Esendere crossing, one of just a handful of official transit points between the two countries, is in a dusty valley high up in the mountains. A guard unlocks the padlock to swing open the big metal gate and an Iranian couple head towards the Iranian customs point. All morning there is a slow but steady flow of people.  Many of them are small traders like Abduluahap Derinsu. He is waiting to cross.""We buy Iranian vegetables and fruit, like kiwi fruit and water melons. And we sell Turkish fabrics and clothes,"" says the 26-year-old. He crosses into Iran most days. ""I don't make much money, and the Iranians make us pay all sorts of charges.  But I don't have a choice - there's no other work round here, no factories. I have to feed a family of 15.""""Iran's isolation could mean new opportunities for our border region,"" says Osman Celik, the deputy chairman of Van Provincial Chamber of Commerce, as he shows off the commemorative plates from his last trip to Iran.He travels to Iran regularly with delegations of local Turkish businessmen. ""If it was down to us, we wouldn't listen to any US or UK embargo - we would just do our business. But there are certain lines you just can't cross. Some problems need to be sorted out at a government level.""Last year, trade between Turkey and Iran was worth US $10bn, and they're hoping it will be doubled by 2011. More than 60% of Turkey's exports go to European countries. So as the government in Ankara, led by the Islamist-rooted AK Party, reaches out to its neighbour, does it risk alienating its traditional allies in the West?""Our prime minister, Mr Erdogan is like a man with two wives -  he wants to please both sides, until one side says enough is enough,"" says Cuneyt Ulsever, a writer and columnist with Hurriyet newspaper. ""I believe in the end, he will face America and turn his back on Iran.""   ""Turkey voted against the UN sanctions, but she's going to have to abide by them. So formally Turkey will probably give the impression to the world that she's abiding by them."" ""But the illegal trading will probably gain some power, and people in the border will find a way to help their Iranian friends.""In the Iranian bazaar in the border town of Yuksekova, everything has come across the border - and much of it has not come through formal channels. In the cramped shops off the long dark corridor Iranian carpets are stacked up, shelves are crammed with Iranian teapots, bags of Iranian sugar vie for space on the floor with Iranian suitcases, and trays of Iranian veterinary medicines sit out in the passageway. One Iranian businessman says he can transfer anything overnight to Iran across the mountains, even a machine as big as a bulldozer.  Rafat Kaya is a Kurdish shepherd from southeastern Turkey. Sometimes, he says, he smuggles goods back and forward to Iran. He points to the mountains and says it take eight hours on horseback from his village to the border. And that's something we keep hearing, locals in both Turkey and Iran know how to avoid border controls. We're told they either pay off customs officials or they take one of the many goat-paths and unofficial routes that cross this 298 miles (480km) mountainous border. So could Turkey ever really be sure exactly what it exports to its neighbour?   What else is being taken into Iran under the radar?Back in Istanbul - the heart of Turkey's booming economy - the district of Aksaray is where Iranians head for if they are looking for Iranian travel agents, Iranian restaurants, Iranian shops and Iranian cargo houses.  It looks like a street in Tehran. A few blocks away, an Iranian dealer agrees to talk to me.   His desk is messy, but he does serious business here. He introduces himself as Mahmud, on the surface, he says, his business is legal. But, he adds, just 10% of his goods go to Iran legally.  ""I export strategic equipment, like aeroplane parts, to Iran,"" Mahmud says as he draws on a cigarette.""Those companies would never sell their goods to Iran - because they have American investors."" He candidly explains how it works.""How do we do it?  A company like mine - we buy the equipment under the name of a Turkish company and the paperwork shows the destination is another country. But in fact the load ends up in Iran."" ""We charge them 80% over the market price, but they need it - so they pay.""",Travelling the smugglers' route from Turkey to Iran,0
George Michael moved to Category C Highpoint Prison,"Jailed pop star George Michael has been transferred to a softer Category C prison.The former Wham! star was moved out of Pentonville Prison on Friday after abandoning plans to apply for bail.The 47-year-old, whose real name is Georgios Panayiotou, moved to Highpoint Prison in Suffolk.The singer was jailed on Tuesday for eight weeks after crashing his Range Rover while under the influence of cannabis.Michael was found slumped at the wheel of a car after it smashed into a branch of Snappy Snaps photo store in Hampstead, north London, in July.The singer admitted driving while unfit through drugs and possessing two cannabis cigarettes when he appeared at London's Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in August.Michael, who had a previous conviction for the same offence, was told by District Judge John Perkins there was no option but jail.On Friday, a bail application on his behalf was cancelled.Michael is expected to serve four weeks in prison.Pentonville Prison, where former inmates have included Oscar Wilde and fellow 1980s singer Boy George, houses close to 1,000 male convicts.A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said the department did not discuss the movement of prisoners.

How super What cyclists make of superhighways,"Cycle lanes have become a familiar feature of city streets in the UK but from Monday, London is raising its game - opening bright blue ""superhighways"" for those putting toe to pedal. But is this a shade of things to come, or just a route to nowhere?Colliers Wood, on the jam-packed A24 and near a huge supermarket saver-centre, seems an improbable place to start a revolution. But just across from the Tube entrance, on the opposite side of the road, a 1.5m-wide painted blue lane has appeared. It is labelled ""CS7"" in white paint and stretches for 8.5 miles along a busy commuter route from this south London suburb into the city centre. It's one of two new superhighways to open this summer. The other goes between Barking, east London, and Tower Gateway, which is near Tower Bridge. Twelve such routes are planned in all, with details and maps available on the Transport for London website.Along with a forthcoming city-wide bike hire scheme, a new cycling police unit, 66,000 extra bike parking spaces before 2012 and better strategic planning, the hope of Mayor Boris Johnson is that they will spark what he calls a ""cycling revolution"". His transport adviser Kulveer Ranger says: ""People think 'cycling revolution' and think of the hire scheme, superhighways... but it's a lot more than that. ""Boris wants to see the culture around cycling evolving - we have to look at the infrastructure, securing bikes, cyclists' safety and embed cycling in transport policy.""Schemes like the London cycling network - a range of routes across the city - were good, he says, but they didn't look strategically at where people needed to go.The London Cycling Campaign (LCC) estimates there are 550,000 cycle journeys in London daily. Transport for London (TfL) says that is an increase from around 250,000 in 2000 and it wants to increase it further, to help reduce pollution and relieve over-crowding on public transport and road congestion. The city's transport body wants to make the roads safer - there were 13 cyclist fatalities in 2009 in the capital. Its aim is to attract those put off by accident statistics and direct them towards continuous, well-marked and maintained, straight-forward commuting routes. So what are the new lanes like to cycle and can they fulfil their aims? An inauspicious start at 8am on a rush-hour morning signals a ""no"". Before you can answer the question: ""Can you cycle easily along the superhighway?"" you need to negotiate another: ""Can you even pull out into it?""With congestion at its height, there are lorries, buses, cars, vans and motorbikes everywhere, across both lanes of this main road, blocking the flash new textured surface on the left hand side. The traffic swarms under the leaden skies of an ugly summer's day. It's raining persistently and the wind gusts. Average British cycling conditions perhaps, but not the best for tempting would-be converts to the cause. But once the traffic blockade is negotiated, and the road begins to widen out a mile further north, it's actually quite a fast route, if you wriggle round the manhole covers. Often cyclists seek out quieter back roads for their journey, avoiding the heavy traffic and its dangers but adding ""long-cuts"". This, however feels like a direct A to B. With the adrenaline pumping and that ET cycle-sequence feeling of bikers all around, it's easy to get carried away with enthusiasm. But, hold the handlebars, isn't this just a glorified cycle lane?Perhaps, but it is a precious thing in the UK's towns and cities - a glorified cycle lane of considerable length, in a purposeful direction, stripped of street furniture and not finishing abruptly without explanation.At the frequent stops for traffic lights, what do the cyclists think of it?Liza Houghton is a bold woman - cycling her one-year-old son in a child seat to his childminder via quieter roads before commuting to work on the superhighway.""They're absolutely brilliant, anything that helps cyclists and makes it safer has to be a good thing,"" she says. ""Cars are being forced to become more aware of cyclists. It's not that safe, you have to be really careful - the close shaves I've had have been with people on their mobile phones."" She draws comparisons with London's European capital cousins. The UK still compares negatively with the cycling ""dream"" of Berlin or Amsterdam, but is better than ""disastrous"" Paris.Others carry their cyclists' insouciance well. Many of those gathered in the bike box at junctions - that space marked with a bike symbol that cars and vans creep into - say they notice little difference and question the benefits.Tony Dann, a former cycle courier with 14 years' experience riding in London, ""can't really see the point"".""They're on the main roads, the traffic's exactly the same as it always has been, there's nothing to stop cars from going in the lanes. I think it gives inexperienced cyclists a false sense of security.""The £23m spent to research the scheme and set up the first of the 12 lanes is ""a waste of money"" he believes. But, he admits, he has no better plan. To the right, some taxi drivers say they find the extra road markings confusing, especially when they fall in a bus lane - how much room should they give?There is no verdict from the van drivers whose windows are wound up against the pelting rain. The blurb from TfL about the lanes makes much of the fact they continue through junctions - but that does nothing to stop some trucks and vans repeatedly turning left and cutting across the cyclists.It's here that the LCC would like to see more investment, they want the city's massive one way junctions returned to two-way traffic and speed limits reduced. ""We're disappointed it's not doing more, but investment has to continue,"" says spokesman Tom Bogdanowicz.At Southwark Bridge, after 45 minutes of cycling, some success lies in crossing the River Thames into the City still in one piece. Not without becoming lost, however - at one of London's most intimidating junctions, Elephant and Castle, the route takes a swing through the back roads but this cyclist missed the cues. Could these routes encourage beginners? Perhaps. The lanes look wide, but they are advisory, not enforced, and shared with the lorries, buses, more experienced cyclists - many can be unforgiving of mistakes.  What cyclists hope they may provide is a highlighted and publicised route where they can come together in a critical mass - that could one day grant them equal reckoning with the bigger beasts of the road.

Trio guilty of Ben Gardner 'Halloween hat' murder,"Three men have been found guilty of murdering an IT worker on Halloween in a row over his girlfriend's hat.Ben Gardner, 30, was punched and kicked in Sutton, south London, in October 2009 after the hat was snatched.Allanna Devine, 28, was also punched as her boyfriend lay injured. The attack happened after Ms Devine asked for her hat back, the Old Bailey heard.Daniel Ransom and Ross Collender, both 21, and Jordan Dixon, 18, of Carshalton, had denied murder.Mr Gardner, who worked for insurance firm Legal &amp; General, had been to a club with Ms Devine to celebrate her birthday.In the early hours of the morning, Ms Devine was waiting for him outside a kebab shop when a group of men snatched a pirate's hat and black wig she was wearing, the court heard.They did not react to the provocation.But later in the evening as they returned to Ms Devine's home they saw the group loitering, the court heard.When she asked for the hat back she was verbally abused.Collender then ""suddenly and unexpectedly"" punched Mr Gardner in the face. He was also punched by Dixon, falling on to his back in the road.Ransom then kicked the ""utterly defenceless"" IT worker in the head.It was described by witnesses as being like a ""penalty kick"" and Mr Gardner died on 1 November from catastrophic brain damage.Mr Gardner's father, David, said, in a statement which was read out in court: ""I cannot forgive these people for what they have done, they have destroyed me and my family for the rest of our lives.""A further statement from the family after the verdict, added: ""We are satisfied with the verdict today as Ben has been deprived of his life and it's only right that these murderers should be deprived of enjoying their lives.""Outside court, Det Insp Bob Campany said: ""This tragic case highlights just how easy the transition from anti-social behaviour to standing trial at the Old Bailey for murdering another human being really is.""Sadly, the stage is set every Friday and Saturday night for innocent young lives, like Ben's, to be taken in this way.""Some young men are just hell-bent on violence, usually when under the influence of drink or drugs or a combination of both, and they plague our town centres.""Ransom, Collender and Dixon were remanded in custody to be sentenced on Friday. Judge Richard Hone said they would be jailed for life but he had to fix a minimum sentence.",Trio guilty of Ben Gardner 'Halloween hat' murder,0
Council awards more work to controversial taxi firm,"Glasgow City Council has given more work to a controversial private taxi firm, despite being in the process of trying to ban it. BBC Scotland has learned that Network Private Hire has successfully increased its share of a contract ferrying vulnerable children to and from school. In April, the council denied Network an operators licence after police argued it had links to crime.The company is appealing the decision and is entitled to continue trading.Glasgow Council has streamlined the amount of school runs it funds from 2000 to 1400, and invited taxi firms to bid for the work. Glasgow Taxis, the main hackney operator who had the majority of the contract until now, is the biggest loser, being outbid on about 60% of its original share.'Increased share'Network and several other taxi firms including Southside cars will pick up a significant amount of the work.Network was already on the council's list of preferred suppliers before the licensing committee's decision to deny its operators licence. But the decision to award extra work to the company took place recently.A spokesman for Glasgow City Council confirmed that Network had increased its share, from 50 to 136 runs per day. The spokesman said: ""Network Private Hire has a contract to provide taxis for council business which predates the recent decision of the Licensing Committee to refuse a licence for their booking office.""This decision is now subject to appeal and therefore Network Private Hire is legally entitled to continue trading while that appeal is pending.""Network's radio office licence was denied at a council licensing committee hearing in April after Strathclyde police argued that a former employee and shareholder who is a convicted criminal was still benefitting from the company.Ch Insp Stuart Neil told the hearing that James Baxter - who has a series of spent criminal convictions, including a serious assault for which he served a prison term - had also been accused of intimidating witnesses and of being involved in a shooting incident, although he was not convicted. Network's legal team admitted that Mr Baxter was still being paid money for shares he had sold to the company. The committee decided Mr Baxter was benefitting from the company and its licence was denied.An appeal is due to be heard in November and Network is entitled to trade in the meantime.

Court reserves judgement over Phil Woolas re-election,"Two High Court judges hearing a challenge to ex-minister Phil Woolas's re-election as an MP have reserved their judgement until October.Legal arguments were heard on the final day of the specially convened election court in Oldham on Thursday.Mr Woolas won his Oldham East and Saddleworth seat by just 103 votes in May's general election.Defeated Lib Dem rival Elwyn Watkins says the vote was swayed by false claims in Labour leaflets.His counsel has accused former immigration minister Mr Woolas of stirring up racial tension by running a ""risky"" campaign designed to ""galvanise the white Sun vote"" against Mr Watkins, because he was convinced he was going to lose his seat.Mr Watkins has accused his opponent of implying that he was in league with extremist Muslims who wanted to kill the former minister.Mr Woolas has defended the leaflets, saying it was legitimate to ask questions about how his opponent funded his campaign, the political company he kept and where he lived.He has argued that he was targeted by extremists, including receiving death threats, because of the nature of the constituency and his national profile as minister responsible for immigration issues and accused Mr Watkins of not condemning them. The case has been brought under Section 106 of the Representation of the People Act which makes it an offence to publish ""any false statement of fact in relation to the candidate's personal character or conduct"" to prevent them being elected - unless they believed it was true and had ""reasonable grounds"" to do so.It is the first case of its kind in 99 years. Legally, the onus is on Mr Watkins to prove his case if he is to win. If found guilty, Mr Woolas could be fined and barred from public office, with a fresh election triggered.Mr Justice Griffith Williams and Mr Justice Nigel Teare have been hearing the case at Saddleworth Civic Hall in Uppermill, Oldham, which has been turned into an election court. A judgement is not expected until October.",Court reserves judgement over Phil Woolas re-election,0
Bristol tram plan may replace bendy buses,"A planned £42m bendy bus scheme for Bristol could be replaced by a cheaper tram scheme.The bus plan was originally announced in 2009 and would have linked Long Ashton park-and-ride with Temple Meads.Bristol City Council has met with tram consultants Sustraco who claim switching to trams could save the authority money.The council will now meet with a government minister to discuss whether either scheme is viable.'Be sensitive'Councillor Gary Hopkins, the council's transport spokesman, said the authority was aware that funding was a big issue.""We are aware the government are reviewing the costings on these schemes and the different viabilities,"" he said.""As some of the money will come from government then we have to be sensitive to their views.""If government decides we'd much rather support a different type of technology then what we're saying to them is we're happy with what we've bid for but if you feel there's a different way forward we'll listen.""Bristol had planned a city-wide £200m tram scheme nine years ago but it was scrapped in 2004 because of escalating costs.",Bristol tram plan may replace bendy buses,0
Dutch troops end Afghanistan deployment,"The Netherlands has ended its military mission in Afghanistan, after four years in which its 1,950 troops have won praise for their effectiveness. Dutch military chief Gen Peter van Uhm said security had improved in Uruzgan province during the Dutch deployment.But he acknowledged that ""a lot still has to happen"" after the withdrawal.Nato has played down its significance, but analysts say this is a sensitive time for the alliance, with growing casualties and doubts about strategy.Dutch command was formally handed over to the US and Australia in a small ceremony on Sunday at the main military base in Uruzgan - where most Dutch soldiers have been deployed.The Dutch ministry of defence told the BBC that while its military mission in Afghanistan had ended, a redeployment task force would stay on to oversee the return of vehicles, military hardware and equipment to the Netherlands. Four F16 jets, three Chinooks and five Apaches from the Dutch air force were expected to remain in Afghanistan until the end of the year.""Dutch forces have served with distinction in Uruzgan, and we honour their sacrifice and that of their Afghan counterparts during the Netherlands' tenure in the province,"" said a statement from the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf).Nato had wanted the Netherlands to extend its mission, but the request triggered a political row which brought down the country's coalition government in February.This sent shock waves through other European countries, particularly Germany, where public opposition to the war is growing.More than 145,000 foreign troops currently operate under US and Nato command in Afghanistan and are supporting its Western-backed government against a Taliban-led insurgency that has gained strength.Having supplied just a small percentage of Nato forces, the Dutch pull-out will not make a significant military difference, says the BBC's David Loyn in Kabul, but it will have a symbolic impact far beyond the troop numbers themselves.  Analysts say the Dutch contingent has pioneered techniques which have since been held up as a model for other foreign forces in Afghanistan. These include the ""3D"" policy - defence, diplomacy and development - which involved fighting the Taliban while at the same time building close contacts with local tribal elders and setting up development programmes.""We offer the majority of the population relatively safe living conditions and advancements in health care, education and trade,"" Gen Van Uhm told a news conference on Wednesday. ""We have achieved tangible results of which the Netherlands can be proud.""Uruzgan is a poor mountainous region north of Helmand and Kandahar, and the Dutch lost far fewer troops than the UK, US and Canada, the main forces further south.  Gen Van Uhm said 24 Dutch troops died during the four-year mission and 140 were wounded. His 23-year-old son was killed by a roadside bomb in April 2008.A Taliban spokesman told the Volkskrant newspaper that the group wanted to ""wholeheartedly congratulate the citizens and government of the Netherlands"" for pulling out its troops and urged others to follow suit.Officials in Brussels insist the rest of the military alliance remains solid and note that the decision of the Dutch to go ahead with the withdrawal did not produce a chain reaction of other announcements about pull-outs.But Canada is still expected to withdraw its forces next year, Poland in 2012, and the UK in 2014 or 2015. With increasing focus on the process - if not the exact timetable - for handing over security to the Afghans, analysts say there is a growing sense that commitments are finite, analysts say.",Dutch troops end Afghanistan deployment,0
Man accused of murdering fiancee in south Belfast,"A man has appeared in court charged with murdering his fiancee in Belfast. Paul Stockman, 53, lived in Elm Court in the south of the city, with his partner of five years Patricia Bardon, whose body was discovered on Monday. A detective told Belfast Magistrates Court he believed he could connect the accused to the charge. It is understood the couple were to have been married on the day Ms Bardon's body was found, which was also her 51st birthday.The detective said both the defendant and the murder victim had alcohol problems and that they had been in a relationship for five years. A defence lawyer told the court there would be no bail application on Friday because the address where the defendant lived was not suitable as it was still a crime scene.",Man accused of murdering fiancee in south Belfast,0
Swedish rape warrant for Wikileaks' Assange cancelled,"Sweden has cancelled an arrest warrant for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange on accusations of rape and molestation.The Swedish Prosecution Authority website said the chief prosecutor had come to the decision that Mr Assange was not suspected of rape but did not give any further explanation.The warrant was issued late on Friday.Wikileaks, which has been criticised for leaking Afghan war documents, had quoted Mr Assange as saying the claims were ""without basis"".That message, which appeared on Twitter and was attributed directly to Mr Assange, said the appearance of the allegations ""at this moment is deeply disturbing"".In a series of other messages posted on the Wikileaks Twitter feed, the whistle-blowing website said: ""No-one here has been contacted by Swedish police"", and that it had been warned to expect ""dirty tricks"".In its ""official blog"" on Saturday before the warrant was cancelled, Wikileaks said it was ""deeply concerned about the seriousness of these allegations. We the people behind Wikileaks think highly of Julian and and he has our full support"".The current whereabouts of Mr Assange, a 39-year-old Australian, are unclear.The Swedish Prosecution Authority website said chief prosecutor Eva Finne had come to the decision that Julian Assange was not subject to arrest.In a brief statement Eva Finne said: ""I don't think there is reason to suspect that he has committed rape."" The website said there would be no further immediate comment.Earlier, Karin Rosander, communications head at Sweden's prosecutors' office, said there were two separate allegations against Mr Assange, one of rape and the other of molestation. She gave no details of the accusations. She said that as far as she knew they related to alleged incidents that took place in Sweden.On Saturday she said the police investigation into the molestation allegation continued.Ms Rosander said: ""The [chief prosecutor] will look into that later. She hasn't been able to do that, but that's not enough for being arrested. It's not a serious enough crime.""Media reports say Mr Assange was in Sweden last week to talk about his work and defend the decision by Wikileaks to publish the Afghan war logs.Last month, Wikileaks published more than 75,000 secret US military documents on the war in Afghanistan. US authorities criticised the leak, saying it could put the lives of coalition soldiers and Afghans, especially informers, at risk.Mr Assange has said that Wikileaks is intending to release a further 15,000 documents in the coming weeks.",Swedish rape warrant for Wikileaks' Assange cancelled,0
Satellites used to track mentally-ill violent criminals,"A satellite tracking scheme designed to monitor the movements of violent offenders with mental health problems is being expanded, following a successful pilot.The system is intended to prevent psychiatric patients absconding or offending while on leave from a secure hospital in south-east London. Patients wear a device around an ankle when they attend court and when they are allowed out of hospital on authorised visits, some of which are unaccompanied.Doctors at the Bethlem Royal Hospital in Beckenham say the number of times patients have breached their leave conditions has fallen substantially since the devices were introduced.The satellite tracking system was introduced after Terrence O'Keefe, a mental health patient, went on the run and strangled a man with his belt in March 2008.O'Keefe had been held at a secure unit at Lambeth Hospital and escaped while being treated at King's College Hospital in south London. In June 2009 O'Keefe was found guilty of murdering David Kemp at Great Yarmouth in Norfolk.  The satellite tracking devices have been used by 35 patients at River House, a medium-security psychiatric unit at Bethlem. The unit treats people with severe mental illness and personality disorders, among them convicted killers and sex offenders. Professor Tom Fahy, clinical director of forensic services at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, said the device added an extra layer of safety when patients were allowed out on ""leave"" to prepare them for life in the community.""The main advantage is that it gives us confidence, about the patient's whereabouts, that they're complying with their leave conditions,"" said Prof Fahy, a consultant psychiatrist.""We can... enhance the trusting relationship between the clinical services and the patient.""The device uses three types of technology to pinpoint a patient's location - GPS (global positioning system), GSM (global system for mobile communication) and RF (radio frequency).It sends signals to a control room which alerts the hospital when a patient goes to an area they're excluded from, or is away for too long.  An accelerometer measures whether the tracking device, and therefore the patient, is moving and at what speed.The device vibrates to remind a patient when they're nearing the end of their allotted time away from hospital.""The information is sent from the tracker up to a monitoring station and they can see the information on a map,"" said Sara Murray, who founded Buddi - the company behind the tracking device - after her daughter disappeared from sight at a supermarket.""They can actually live-track somebody, so if somebody is missing they can immediately see where they are and follow them.""One of the patients who used the device while at River House told BBC News that it had helped to keep him ""more safe"".""If I was to have an accident of any kind it would be easier to pick me up,"" said the man, who wanted to be known as Edward to safeguard his anonymity.But Edward, who now lives in a hostel after 13 years in secure hospitals following a conviction for arson, said the tracker was uncomfortable when worn for long periods.""Sometimes it makes you feel a bit childish... almost labelled,"" he said.But Professor Fahy says the satellite tracking system has been successful in cutting the number of times patients have breached their leave conditions.Doctors also hope the system will cut the costs of searching for patients who have absconded . Each device, including straps, costs £374, plus £50 per month per device for monitoring. The unit now has 60 devices and plans to use it on more patients over the coming months.

Man Utd: Red Knights takeover attempt shelved,"The Red Knights group of wealthy supporters mulling a takeover of Manchester United has put plans to make a bid for the club on hold.The group said media speculation of ""inflated valuation aspirations"" had hampered its plans.It added that it had always maintained it would only pay a sensible price for Manchester United.Last week, United reiterated it was not for sale and that the Glazer family owners would not listen to offers.The Glazer family bought Manchester United for £800m in 2005.However, critics say the family has saddled the club with massive debts. In the last annual accounts, to July 2009, debts at the club's parent company Red Football Joint Venture increased to £716.5m. The Red Knights group - which includes the former Football League chairman Keith Harris and Goldman Sachs chief economist Jim O'Neill - had said that one of its priorities was to reduce debt levels.The group had been expected to make a bid of about £1bn for United, however reports have suggested that the Glazer family put a much higher value on the club.Last week, Manchester United said the club was not for sale and that the Glazer family owners would ""not entertain any offers"", adding that the Glazers remained ""fully committed to their long-term ownership of the club"".In a statement, the Red Knights said that it remained committed to pursuing its efforts ""to try and help bring ownership of Manchester United to its supporters, and under a structure with materially less debt"".""As we have maintained however since news of our ambitions first emerged in March, we will only attempt to purchase the club at a sensible price, consistent with the long term interests of the club,"" the group added.""Persistent speculation in the media of inflated valuation aspirations has made our goals less attainable, as potential investors have strongly reinforced our views that we should not move forward at a price uneconomic for the future of the club.""Manchester United fans have launched a campaign to oust the Glazers, with many boycotting the traditional red shirts and scarves and instead wearing green and gold, the original colours of Newton Heath, the amateur side which was founded in 1878 and became Manchester United.There has also been talk of supporters not renewing season tickets, in an attempt to hit revenue streams at the club.The Manchester United Supporters Trust, which has backed the Red Knights' campaign, said last month that it had not called for a boycott.However, it added it was ""encouraging supporters to delay renewal of season tickets and executive facilities until at least the first deadline and ideally until a Red Knight bid comes forward"".""If the Glazers reject a bid or indeed are still here next season we will review that position accordingly,"" it added.The trust also said it believed the Red Knights had not totally walked away, but were waiting for the price of Manchester United to fall.""We understand the intention of the statement from the Red Knights is to remove the time deadline pressure and set more realistic expectations with regard to a bid,"" the trust said.In its statement, the Red Knights group said: ""We understand that many supporters were hoping that we might be in a position to make a bid before the season ticket renewal deadline.""We have never taken a stance on season ticket renewals, it is a personal choice for all supporters.""

Prince Charles attends last Fromelles soldier reburial,"The last of 250 British and Australian World War I troops recovered from mass graves has been reburied with full military honours in northern France. Prince Charles and the relatives of identified soldiers attended a commemorative ceremony at the new Fromelles Military Cemetery.It comes 94 years after the soldiers were killed in the Battle of Fromelles. Work to excavate and identify the soldiers began two years ago, after the bodies were discovered. Of the bodies recovered, 205 have now been identified as belonging to Australian soldiers, three served with the British army and 42 are still classified as unknown. The remains of the first soldier were reburied in January.Opening the ceremony to mark the anniversary of the battle, the Duke of Kent, president of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, said the soldiers were ""lost no longer... here, at last, in peace"".Relatives of those killed during the battle paid tribute to their family members, reading moving extracts from diaries and letters home. The last letter from Thomas Sidney Wharfs, to his wife, dated 18 July 1916, said: ""My darling wife I am writing this to be sent to you in case anything happens and I am killed tonight. I have just been ordered to attack tomorrow and I'm taking my company over, in the front line.  ""I am absolutely confident of my men and we'll get through, all correctly but we're certain to have casualties. Cheer up and take care of Dick.  You will need all your strength to bring him up and look after him.  God bless you my darling wife and boy.  I love you with all my heart.""Another Australian relative said: ""My grandfather, Private Frank Flowers, was killed on this day 94 years ago, leaving his wife and three small children. I would like to read a few lines from his last letter to home. ""It may be of help to you to know that every day of my life I pray to God to protect and help you and our children. I pray to him for your sake and for the kiddies' sake that I may be sent back to you, not for my own sake... as I know the heart would go out of your life were I to go under.'""The relative added: ""Thank you, Grandad, for the lives we have been able to live.""During the ceremony, a general service wagon, which had been restored after its use during WWI, carried the last coffin on its poignant journey. Behind it, Prince Charles processed with members of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery.Following the Last Post and a one-minute silence, the Prince of Wales and the Governor-General of Australia, Quentin Bryce, laid the first wreaths.Dedicating the ceremony, the prince said: ""In laying this last hero to rest, we honour them all.""He continued: ""I am profoundly humbled by the outstanding bravery of these men who fought so valiantly in the indescribable mud and carnage, many thousands of miles from their families and from their homes.""After the reburial of the last unknown soldier, the Prince of Wales, accompanied by the Duchess of Cornwall, attended a reception for relatives.The BBC's Robert Hall said the reburials had ""united families from opposite sides of the world"". He said the Battle of Fromelles - a diversionary tactic in the wider Battle of the Somme - was a ""terrible and bloody encounter"".About 1,700 British servicemen and more than 5,500 Australian soldiers lost their lives in the two-day battle. In the aftermath of the battle, the dead Allied soldiers were buried by their German counterparts. The mass graves were only discovered in 2008. As part of the identification process, overseen by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, experts took DNA samples from the bodies to try to find a family link with the help of the soldiers' relatives. Earlier, the Duke of Kent unveiled a Eurostar train called Remembering Fromelles at St Pancras station, London.   ",Prince Charles attends last Fromelles soldier reburial,0
Padraic White appointed interim chairman of NI Water,"A former managing director of the Irish Republic's Industrial Development Authority (IDA) has been appointed interim chairman of NI Water.Padraic White replaces Chris Mellor who was sacked by Regional Development Minister Conor Murphy in March.Mr Mellor and three other board members were dismissed following a damning independent investigation into procurement practices.However, some MLAs have since raised questions about that investigation.Mr White was the first chairman of the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA), the agency responsible for developing Ireland's first light rail system, the Luas, in Dublin.He has chaired the boards of a wide range of private, public and community bodies including the West Belfast and Shankill Economic Task Force.His wife Mary White was elected as a Fianna Fail member of the Senate in the Irish Parliament in July 2002 and re-elected in July 2007.The £40,000 a year appointment will be for an initial period of up to nine months, until a permanent appointment process is conducted.In June the minister appointed four new interim non-executive directors.All these appointments have been carried out through an emergency process, meaning they do not have to abide by the code of practice for public appointments, although the Commissioner for Public Appointments has been consulted.The minister said: ""I welcome the appointment of Padraic White who will bring his wealth of skills and experience to bear in providing a steadying influence on the Board of NIW following what has been a difficult time for the organisation.",Padraic White appointed interim chairman of NI Water,0
Raoul Moat: Prime minister criticises public sympathy,"Prime Minister David Cameron has said there should be no sympathy for ""callous murderer"" Raoul Moat.Mr Cameron was speaking after flowers were left at the scene of Moat's death in Northumberland and messages of sympathy to him were left on Facebook.Pc David Rathband, shot by Moat as he sat in a patrol car, has said he was now blind as a result of the attack.But he told The Sun newspaper he would not let the incident ruin his life.Moat shot Samantha Stobbart, 22, and killed her boyfriend Chris Brown. The gunman went on the run and apparently shot himself in Rothbury on Saturday.Speaking during Prime Minister's Question Time, Mr Cameron said: ""It is absolutely clear that Raoul Moat was a callous murderer, full stop, end of story.""I cannot understand any wave, however small, of public sympathy for this man.""There should be sympathy for his victims and the havoc he wreaked in that community.""There should be no sympathy for him.""Conservative MP Chris Heaton-Harris asked him to contact Facebook requesting the RIP Raoul Moat group page, which has attracted more than 30,000 members, be taken down.He described it as carrying a ""whole host of anti-police statements"".Mr Cameron said he was making a ""very good point"".But a spokeswoman for Facebook said the page would not be removed on the grounds the site encourages public debate about issues in the media.She added: ""Facebook is a place where people can express their views and discuss things in an open way as they can and do in many other places, and as such we sometimes find people discussing topics others may find distasteful, however that is not a reason in itself to stop a debate from happening.  ""The site has measures in place which allow people to report any material they find offensive and each complaint would be investigated on an individual basis.""As well as tributes posted online, flowers and cards have been left outside Moat's home in Fenham, Newcastle, and at the scene of his death in Rothbury.Meanwhile, Mr Rathband told The Sun newspaper about the moment Moat approached his patrol car, wielding a gun.""He looked at me and I looked at him and he lifted the gun and discharged the weapon through my window.""It was a noise I had never heard before but it was a noise that was so painful. My first assumption was it was the noise that was ripping my face off.""Mr Rathband said after a second shot was fired to his shoulder, emergency crews arrived at the scene.He added: ""I asked a paramedic to tell my wife that I loved her and to tell my children that I loved them.""I knew I was going to die.""Northumbria Police have said they would not comment on the story in the newspaper but that Mr Rathband was interviewed as a victim of a crime, not as a police officer. On Wednesday, police arrested three men on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Damien Hirst art works 'inspired by others',"A group that lobbies against conceptual art has claimed 15 works by the artist Damien Hirst were inspired by others.The alleged cases are detailed in an article in art magazine The Jackdaw.Charles Thomson, co-founder of the Stuckists art movement, alleges that several Hirst works - among them his medicine cabinets and spin paintings - were based on existing pieces.Hirst's press officer called the piece ""poor journalism"" and said the artist would issue a ""comprehensive"" rebuttal.In an article entitled The Art Damien Hirst Stole, Thomson presents 15 examples of Hirst works beside images of the works he claims they are inspired by.They include his 2005 piece In Nomine Patris, an eviscerated sheep in formaldehyde positioned in a crucifixion pose.Thomson alleges that Hirst got the idea for the piece from This Is My Body, This Is My Blood, a 1986 work by artist John LeKay which also featured a so-called crucified sheep.Other pieces cited include his installation Pharmacy, a cabinet with bottles on shelves Thomson says was based on a 1943 work by Joseph Cornell.Hirst is well known for his headline-grabbing conceptual artworks, which include sharks suspended in formaldehyde and a skull encrusted in diamonds.Last year the 45-year-old announced he had stopped making installations in favour of traditional paintings by hand.Unproven allegations of plagiarism have dogged Hirst since he made his name as one of the ""YBAs"" - Young British Artists - who came to prominence in the 1990s.Of the 15 allegations made in The Jackdaw, eight are said to be new.",Damien Hirst art works 'inspired by others',0
Mountain biker dies after collapse on Conwy trail,"A 54-year-old man has collapsed and died when mountain biking along a popular forest track in Snowdonia.It happened on Saturday evening on the Marin Trail near Betws-y-Coed when the man, from Flintshire, was cycling with a brother and friend. An ambulance could get only within a quarter of a mile so an Ogwen mountain rescue team went to help.Attempts to revive the cyclist, who had suffered chest pains, were made but without success. Rescue team members carried him on a stretcher to an ambulance. ",Mountain biker dies after collapse on Conwy trail,0
Cumbrian school among those piloting new gun toy,"A Cumbrian primary school is testing an educational toy designed to encourage children to talk about guns.The Guns Thumball is a soft ball with names of 32 types of gun, from a Mac-10 to a water pistol, printed on it.The firm behind it said it was ""even more important"" for children to discuss guns in light of Derrick Bird fatally shooting 12 people in the county.Bassenthwaite Primary's head said it enabled pupils to talk about guns' role in society in a ""safe and fun way"".Children at the school in Bassenthwaite, Cumbria, are among those in a pilot group trying out the ball before it goes on sale.Promote discussionThe toy is thrown around a classroom, with the person who catches it lifting their thumb and reading from the panel underneath. It is then used to promote discussion in the classroom about how guns are used in different scenarios.Head teacher Sara Royle said: ""The new Guns Thumball gives us the opportunity to positively encourage the students to talk about the role that guns have in society in a safe and fun way.""Ch Supt Geoff Feavyour of Leicestershire Police, a strategic firearms commander, backed the ball but recognised it might be controversial.""I can understand the sensitivity, but we are fooling ourselves if we think our kids don't arrive at school without exposure to guns, gun issues, and in some cases gun culture,"" he said.He admitted some may see guns as a taboo subject, but said children were often exposed to ""unrealistic, positive and even glamorous"" views of the weapons.""I can understand that parents, even teachers, may be concerned that guns should be a taboo subject in an educational environment, and I can't help but think this is very similar to some attitudes to sex education,"" he added.""Talking about things in a controlled educational environment rarely makes things worse, and if we can improve awareness, there is the very real possibility that lives can be altered,"" he said.Rosie Fey of Keswick-based Happy Secrets, the firm that developed the ball, said the toy was inspired by the visit of a firearms sergeant to the shop while he was on holiday in Cumbria.""We want to make children thoughtful around the word 'gun', and to de-glamorise it,"" she said while describing the design process behind it.Mike Burgess, executive director of the company, said the Cumbria massacre had ""raised awareness of guns, even for young children"" and that ""it has made it even more important that it is used as a topic of discussion.""Taxi driver Derrick Bird sparked a massive police manhunt when he went on the rampage in west Cumbria in June, shooting dead 12 people and injuring 11 others.

'Whole community' needed to tackle suicide," A parish priest in west Belfast has called on the whole community to come together to tackle the problem of suicide.Father John Forsythe, of Christ the Redeemer in Lagmore, will say Requiem Mass at the funeral of Liam McGuinness later on Friday.The 19-year-old amateur boxer took his own life earlier this week.His death is believed to have been the tenth suicide in the Lagmore area in recent months. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said as many as 21 people have taken their own lives in the area this year.Speaking to BBC Good Morning Ulster, Father Forsythe said there had been a 111% increase in suicide deaths in Northern Ireland.""In 2005 there were 213 deaths, in 2006 there were 291, it's nearly equal to the road deaths. A quarter of all the deaths of young people between the ages of 15 and 34 are attributed to suicide,"" he said.""What concerns me is that there seems to be a spike of it in west Belfast; in east Belfast and mid-Ulster it's very, very low.""Father Forsythe said suicide was an issue that needed to be looked at by the whole community.""We need to look out for each other, we need to care for each other. We can't just watch young people standing under a bush in the middle of the evening drinking until two o'clock in the morning.""Some of the things that will help are mixing with different religious backgrounds and respect for those who are asking for help. It's a multi-faceted thing, you cannot point at one magic bullet that will solve it.""Mr Adams, as the MP for West Belfast, has called on the health minister to ensure funding for suicide prevention in Northern Ireland is ring-fenced. He described it as a ""crisis"" which needed action from the executive.",'Whole community' needed to tackle suicide,0

French discuss the pensions fuel blockade,"France has begun importing electricity as protesters against pension reforms block fuel depots for a seventh day. Millions of striking workers have poured on to the streets across France ahead of a vote on raising the retirement age later this week. Here three French citizens explain how the strikes, protests and blockades have affected them and what they think of the reforms.There is no petrol left here. They tried to open the refineries and managed to remove all the students and protesters but then they just came back and the refineries had to close again. To make things worse, every morning, protesters are blocking the main line of the town's tram system. The system only has three lines, so it means many of my friends are having to get to work by bike. Everywhere I look there are lots of bikes and although I'm still driving to work, it is taking me much longer than usual. As an English and IT teacher, I will definitely suffer financially from the strikes.Next week, those students who have been managing to attend classes will have run out of petrol and won't be able to get here - and I will have to cancel lessons. The carers and canteen staff at my 10-year-old son's school are on strike which means we can no longer drop him off early at 0730 and collect him late at 1800. All the parents are having to rally round and help each other - sometimes I think it is a bit like the war! My daughter is at university, so is looking after herself but has had to walk there and back a few times now - it takes 80 minutes each way.I have a nasty feeling that Friday will be the worst day. They are gearing up for something big for sure. But there will be no fights breaking out at petrol stations, as everyone I have spoken to is sympathetic with the protesters.The problem is not that we will work until 65 or 67, it is the fact that the upper house of the legislature and the parliament are making no effort whatsoever over their golden pensions. The French find this totally unjust and are striking because once again the government is asking them to work longer for less money, whereas they are working less for more money. The French have had enough.The city where I live is having lots of difficulties. I decided over the weekend to stop using my car, as there is no petrol, and use public transport instead. But today I had to use my car to get to work, because there are no buses. I ran out of petrol earlier and got stuck in a little town next to Rennes with no means of getting back. Luckily my boss came to pick me up. Everything is blocked. Petrol stations are closed and barricaded with shopping trolleys. Bus depots are blocked with huge lorries. I saw a lorry earlier parked across the road, so that nobody would be able to go through. It is complete chaos. When people here decide to strike, they block the entrances to places, it is very radical. I have seen lots of fights in the streets, which is not uncommon. People take it all very seriously, but they also take advantage of the situation and some start drinking and creating trouble. I saw a man with a bloody nose this morning.I am standing right next to a building which has been covered in graffiti. There is graffiti everywhere and the city is normally so nice. People cannot go to work, which means they cannot earn money. Most contracts here are on an hourly rate, so if you do not turn up for whatever the reason - you do not earn a wage. I don't know how long this will continue but ordinary people are badly affected. I was talking to someone who complained about the lack of petrol, but straight after that he said: ""Still, I am happy they are blocking the petrol.""People in this country always take things to the streets and it always works. I am not so sure about it this time round. The government seems to be putting on pressure and this situation cannot continue for too long - we need to work to live.I guess it is like every strike - we need to wait it out, but I think people will get bored with it in the end. We live outside of the Ile-de-France department but work mainly in Paris and the suburbs. We have been completely taken hostage by protesters. Me and my husband both work as English language teachers for companies and universities. Our work is on a freelance basis, so when we do not work, we do not get paid.All the petrol stations in Paris are empty and if this continues for too long, many people and companies will suffer. There are a few where you can buy fuel, but you have to queue for hours.We are lucky because my parents live in a house near Paris, so for the moment we are staying with them. If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have been able to commute.My husband and I are for the reform to increase the pension age, because we do not have any other choice. The reform will go through, the government will win. These protests are useless. So many companies will go out of business because of them. People in the private sector are against this movement.",French discuss the pensions fuel blockade,0
Online dating scam: fraudsters pose as American soldiers,"""I had lost my husband to cancer and for a year and a half I didn't know what to do with myself.  ""I've got to move on, I thought.  So I joined an over-50's dating site.""Jean - not her real name - was soon contacted by a man named ""Alex"", who claimed to be a soldier in the US Army. He said his wife had left him, that he was raising his teenage son alone, and that he was soon leaving for a tour of Afghanistan.""We struck up a friendship, talking by instant message. He said he was going to come and see me. He said all the right things.""Weeks into their blossoming friendship, Alex claimed his son had changed the PIN for his cash card and he was in financial dire straits. Jean offered to help and sent Alex some money. But it wasn't a one-off favour.Costly sob storySpeaking to the 5 live Investigates programme, Jean recalled how Alex's requests for money began to snowball: ""It went on and on. I kept helping him and his son with various things - domestic bills, school fees and things like that.""""At one point, he [Alex] told me he had gone AWOL and was back in Los Angeles, in a military prison, and needed more money to get out.""""I ended up giving him more than £100 000.""Jean is not alone and is one of a rising number of women to fall victim to this particular form of online dating fraud, where the scammer poses as a US soldier - they often say they're stationed at a US base in the UK, to inspire hope that a relationship is possible.The yarn spun by ""Alex"" - deserted by his wife; single father - is a common one. A desperate request for money is inevitable. The fraudsters behind the scam are often based in West Africa - Nigeria in particular - and it can prove very hard for authorities to track them down.They will sometimes use the names of real American soldiers - including those killed in action - and steal photos from military websites or the social media profiles of real soldiers to make their own dating profiles appear legitimate. This US soldier-in-distress online dating con has come to the attention of the United States Embassy in London. Scam on the riseSpeaking to the BBC, Consul General Derwood Staeben said people contacting the embassy to report dating fraud was now a daily occurrence:""When I arrived at my post two years ago, there were two or three a week. We've had more than 10 in the last five days.""""In the last 10 months, here at the embassy, we've logged around 450 phone calls and just shy of 2,000 emails.""This rise has also been recognised by the National Fraud Authority - earlier this year it reported a four-fold increase in the number of people reporting online dating fraud to the Action Fraud helpline. Rebecca - not her real name - is another victim who was sweet-talked by a fake soldier named ""Charlie"". She will not reveal how much money she has lost but says she is in a lot of debt as a result of the scam. She says she fears opening her mail, or answering her phone, as she doesn't know how to repay the money she borrowed to lend to Charlie. Like fellow victim Jean, she said the men posing as soldiers really know how to exploit the emotions of the women they hope to con. ""I was recently in hospital for an operation and on my way down to the theatre, he was texting me to say he was going to pray for me and he would soon be with me to take care of me.""""They go to great lengths to appear realistic. Sometimes you even get gifts - I was sent flowers, balloons and teddy bears, and would receive poems and emails every day.""They take weeks - in my case, months - to build up trust, asking you about your family and life, and making you feel loved.""Then they tell you a sob story about them being left alone with a child - they even send text messages and emails supposedly from their child.""Elaborate planOne of the common requests from the bogus soldiers is to ask the women they are conning to apply for leave on their behalf, so that they can come and visit them. This follows an elaborate set-up, where the women are asked to complete official-looking paperwork - and send a fee, which they are told will be refunded.This is what happened to Rebecca. She was even having daily telephone conversations with a man she believed was a US Army benefit officer, to help process Charlie's leave application - this was in fact another scammer posing as a US Army official.The US Embassy says that while specific procedures for requesting and granting leave differ among the branches of the US Armed Forces, the request and authorisation to take leave is between the individual service member and his immediate command - family, friends and third parties are never involved.Alarm bells began to ring for Rebecca when she was sent what was purported to be US Army documentation to convince her that Charlie was able to repay her the money she had been lending him. It claimed he had assets worth $1.4m (£890,000). ""No soldier has that kind of money,"" says Rebecca.""That's when I rang the US Army and they told me they hadn't heard of him.""Facebook campaignWhile researching this story, the 5 live Investigates team spoke to dozens of women ripped off in this way. The majority are too embarrassed to share their story publicly but Rebecca and Jean were keen to speak, to try to ensure other women did not suffer the same fate. Today Rebecca is involved in a Facebook campaign, titled 'Stop the US Army Dating Scam' in the hope that she can warn other women of this costly hoax. Since starting the campaign, she has been contacted by more than 240 other women who have also fallen victim to phoney soldiers through online dating sites. Not all of them have lost cash but many have bought laptops, mobile phones and cameras, which they sent to addresses where the ""soldiers"" said they had friends. The US Embassy says anyone who has been a target of dating fraud should report their case to their local police force. Rebecca reported her case but was told there was no chance of her ever getting her money back. However, in Jean's case, police did manage to trace some of the money she sent to accounts in Nigeria and California. They recovered just over £13,000 - small consolation when the total sum she sent was close to £100,000. A year on after being caught out, Jean is utterly distraught knowing she was conned and feels she has let her family down.""What hurts the most is that when my husband died of cancer, he put everything in order. He had arranged for money to be invested so I could draw an income each month and I could have a decent lifestyle. And I went and wasted all the money and that broke my heart.""""I have three teenage grandchildren. I like to help them out, give them pocket money. But of course I had to tell them about this and tell them that it meant I can't give them anything any more."" ""I'm close to my family and I feel I let them all down.""

And now look what you did.""You can hear the full report on 5 live Investigates on Sunday, 26 September at 2100 BST on BBC Radio 5 live.

South Africa recalls ambassador to Rwanda,"South Africa has recalled its ambassador to Rwanda following a diplomatic row over the shooting of an exiled Rwandan general in Johannesburg.Gen Faustin Kayumba Nyamwasa, a critic of Rwandan President Paul Kagame, was shot and wounded in June.South Africa said it had not broken diplomatic ties and no connection was being made between the ambassador's withdrawal and the shooting.Rwanda denies any involvement in the shooting of the general.""We have recalled our ambassador to Rwanda for consultations,"" said South African foreign ministry director general Ayanda Ntsaluba.""Let me be categorical. We have not broken diplomatic relations with Rwanda,"" he added.He said the two countries were in discussions.Rwanda summoned South Africa's ambassador to Kigali, Gladstone Dumisani Gwadiso, last month to discuss the investigation into Gen Nyanwasa's shooting.The former head of the Rwandan army was shot on 19 June. He survived and said President Kagame had ordered the attack.Five people have been charged in South Africa over the murder, but their nationalities have not been revealed.Mr Kagame is standing for re-election to a second seven-year term as president on Monday.He is widely expected to win despite facing criticism for a spate of attacks on government critics in recent months.The Rwandan government has vehemently denied any involvement in the attacks. But the events have raised international concern about what is happening in Rwanda.Critics say there is a long history of murders and disappearances of political opponents in Rwanda.But Mr Kagame remains popular for restoring stability after the 1994 genocide and overseeing strong economic growth.",South Africa recalls ambassador to Rwanda,0

What happened to Rod Stewart the songwriter,"What happened to Rod Stewart the songwriter?The last original song the man behind global smash Maggie May released was the title track of 1998 album When We Were the New Boys. It was the only original on an album full of tracks written by other artists.Since then, Stewart has concentrated on album after album of his Great American Songbook series and other cover collections.""You could say we're addicted to it, really,"" he says in trademark raspy voice, made hoarser by a bout of flu.""You could go on, I could record another five - we'd never run out of songs.""All of those cover albums to date - beginning with 2002's first Great American Songbook - have gone platinum in the UK and the US.Stewart's fifth and final instalment of his lushly-orchestrated series features ""good cocktail hour, dinner party music"" including I Get A Kick Out Of You, I've Got You Under My Skin and Beyond The Sea.Diehard Rod fans will lap it up. But don't they also deserve to know why the 65-year-old - who wrote such hits as You Wear It Well, Hot Legs, Baby Jane and Every Beat Of My Heart - has dried up when it comes to penning his own hits?Stewart fires back a series of explanations.""There's many reasons, I don't feel the desire at the moment - I haven't met somebody I feel I can write with. ""It's difficult to get the new material played with us old-timers, it really is. ""I think we've had a fair crack of the whip, so we can't complain. ""I wanna do a blues album, I wanna do a country album, so maybe after all that's done I can get someone to write with.""His most famed composition, 1971's Maggie May, propelled him to worldwide fame.Although it was co-written with guitarist Martin Quittenton, Stewart says his memories of creating it begin with Ronnie Wood strumming Bob Dylan's 1965 song It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.Wood, latterly a Rolling Stone, was Stewart's bandmate in The Faces.""I think the first two chords may be similar, the melody's not,"" Stewart says.""We did it at Lansdowne Studios in London and it was one of those where we went round the pub first and then saw what we got.""That's humble beginnings for a song which was originally the B-side to Reason to Believe before it was reclassified as the A-side thanks to public reaction. It went on to top the UK and US charts for five weeks each.""When it went to number one in Britain and America, that's when we all went out and got drunk,"" Stewart says.""The drinking went on for a long time and why not?""He says he remembers visiting his parents shortly afterwards: ""That was probably the most gratifying, more than any big cheque or new car or whatever, to know that not just my mum and dad but my whole family had stood by me.""They weren't the type to say 'get yourself a day job, it's not going to last', which is not what you want to hear when you're a musician.""But will the former mod, who is due to become a father for the eighth time next year, ever again celebrate a self-written hit?It's only when asked if he ever writes that things become clear.""No, never. It's always been hard work.""The nearest thing that this business I'm in comes to being a job is when I've had to write songs.""This is not an ageing rocker with a chronic case of writers' block. This is an ageing rocker who hates writing songs.Stewart adds by way of a further admission: ""Speak to anyone in The Faces, they'll say 'We had to lock him in a room and take the key away to get him to finish the lyrics to a song'.""So it was always like being at school.""He continues: ""When you think of the minimal amount of songs that I've written and how many of them have been successful, you could say I've got an impressive strike rate.""And while he hasn't completely ruled out a return to songwriting - ""I wouldn't say that it'll never happen, it could happen"" - don't hold your breath.His coming out as a successful songwriter who detests writing songs marks him out as unusual.But his success in recording long-established songs speaks for itself.In the US, his last six albums have yielded two number ones, two number twos and two number fours.And in album sales by British artists in America in the 2000s, he was outsold only by The Beatles and Coldplay.Perhaps the real question is why would Rod Stewart bother to write another song?Fly Me to the Moon...The Great American Songbook Volume V is out in the UK on Monday.",What happened to Rod Stewart the songwriter,0

Canadian priest sorry for giving dog Holy Communion,"A priest in Canada has apologised after giving Holy Communion to a dog.Reverend Marguerite Rea of St Peter's Anglican Church, in Toronto, received complaints from Christians all over Canada after she fed communion bread to a German Shepherd cross named Trapper.Area Bishop Patrick Yu said the priest had contravened church policy with her ""strange and shocking"" actions.Ms Rea said it had been a ""simple church act of reaching out"" to a new congregation member and his pet.""If I have hurt, upset or embarrassed anyone, I apologise,"" she told her congregation on Sunday morning, the Toronto Star reports.The canine controversy began last month when four-year-old Trapper and his owner, Donald Keith, 56, attended the church in Toronto's downtown area for the first time.""The minister welcomed me and said come up and take communion, and Trapper came up with me and the minister gave him communion as well,"" Mr Keith told the Toronto Star.""I thought it was a nice way to welcome me into the church. I thought it was acceptable. There was an old lady in the front just beaming when she saw this.""But not all parishioners at the service were quite so charmed by the sight of the priest leaning down and placing a wafer on the wagging tongue of Trapper, a German Shepherd-Rhodesian ridgeback cross.Communion bread is considered by Anglicans to represent the body of Jesus Christ.One onlooker filed a complaint with the Anglican Diocese of Toronto about the incident and has since left the church.When news spread of the canine communion, St Peter's Church began receiving e-mails from angry Christians all over the country.""Communion is a symbol of the sacrifice of Jesus' body; he died for all of us.

New Workington bridges plan put to public,"Plans for the replacement of two bridges destroyed by floods in Cumbria are to be put before the public.Cumbria County Council has submitted a proposal for a pedestrian crossing at the site of Navvies Bridge which was damaged beyond repair last November.A temporary replacement for Northside Bridge, which collapsed, opened in April and the council is considering a permanent option.Public information sessions are being held on Tuesday and Wednesday.They are taking place in the former Select shop on Washington Square in the town.The bow-arched design for Navvies Bridge is the result of consultation with residents and local stakeholders at two ""Workington Connected"" events in May.Councillor Tony Markley, cabinet member for highways and economic development, said: ""The proposal really is for a structure that will show how the town and its people have recovered from the floods.""",New Workington bridges plan put to public,0
Ryanair tells girl to buy £190 plane seat for violin,"A Cheshire music student was ordered to buy an extra seat for her violin after an airline refused to let her take the instrument as hand luggage.Francesca Rijks, 12, from Macclesfield, was flying home with her family from Dusseldorf after a holiday in Germany.Staff told them to put the violin in the hold - which would potentially ruin the instrument.Francesca and her family got off the plane to buy the ticket, and missed the flight.They had been advised to buy the £190 ticket after calling the airline.The family ended up flying back with Easyjet, who let them board the plane with the violin as hand luggage. Francesca's father Harmen Rijks, 49, said he was told by Ryanair customer service when he bought the tickets that the valuable violin could be taken on board the flight as hand luggage.He said the air pressure and low temperature in the hold would have ruined the instrument, which belongs to the Manchester music school Chetham's, where Francesca is a pupil.He said: ""When we checked in, Francesca was carrying the violin on her back so they must have noticed it but they let us through. ""But when we got to the gates they refused to let us go.""They said we could pay extra to put the violin in the hold, but because of the temperature and air pressure difference, the wood can crack and completely ruin a violin. The insurance also becomes void,"" he said.""This was an absolute disgrace. Their policy appears to discriminate against violinists, the vast majority of whom simply can't afford to purchase an additional seat,"" he added.The Ryanair website says small musical instruments can be taken on board their flights but customers have to purchase an extra seat if they are larger than standard baggage.A spokesman for Ryanair said: ""Ryanair's website, booking confirmation page and the e-mailed itinerary which is sent to every passenger is very clear in relation to the carriage of musical instruments and states that smaller musical items, such as a guitar, violin or viola which exceed our cabin baggage dimensions may be carried in the cabin but only if an extra seat has been purchased to accommodate the instrument.  ""This policy, which must be accepted by every passenger before a booking can be made, ensures that such instruments, which can be expensive, remain with the passenger.  ""As all Ryanair employees are aware of our baggage policies, Ryanair is confident that at no time was this passenger advised that they could bring any piece of non-conforming carry-on luggage onto our aircraft.""The Incorporated Society of Musicians (ISM) is now warning anyone intending to travel with a small instrument to check very carefully before travelling and to ensure their instruments will be accepted as hand luggage before booking any flights. David Abrahams, head of legal services at the ISM, said: ""The idea that musicians should be forced to purchase an additional seat on board an aircraft because they are carrying an instrument that can be stored safely in the overhead lockers is unfair, discriminatory and irrational. ""These airlines are punishing musicians for being musicians.""",Ryanair tells girl to buy £190 plane seat for violin,0

McCausland shows dismay at IFA,"Sports Minister Nelson McCausland has expressed his disappointment at the situation at the IFA.Last weekend, four members of its executive, including president Raymond Kennedy and vice-president David Martin resigned with immediate effect.Mr Kennedy will now remain on the IFA's executive board so it has a working quorum, but will offer his resignation at a council meeting in September.Mr McCausland described the events as ""sad"".""Over the course of the week I have been stopped by people in the street that I have been talking to and they have just shaken their heads, people are lost for words,"" he said.""If it wasn't so ridiculous, it would at times be funny, but it is not.""It is a sad situation.""Mr McCausland had already made it clear that substantial government funding for football would be put at risk if Mr Kennedy and Mr Martin remained in their jobs at the IFA.He said on Thursday that he was pleased the IFA had assured him that an independent review of its governance arrangement would take place, but was disappointed this was not already under way.He said he felt this could be completed within a ""matter of months"".""This is a structural issue it is not simply about two individuals, that's the symptom of a deeper problem,"" he added.""The best thing is to have an independent review carried out in a way that will ensure that I as the minister, sports people, football fans, teams, everyone has assurance and confidence in the organisation and we have governance that is fit for purpose.""The question is not if the IFA gets its house in order, the question is when the IFA gets its house in order.""The IFA confirmed earlier this week that it had received the resignations of Mr Kennedy, Mr Martin, honorary treasurer Neil Jardine and board member Jim Shaw. The IFA council will meet on 6 September to determine the process to be followed for the election of office bearers at the September council meeting. The IFA statement on Tuesday confirming Mr Kennedy would remain on the IFA board until next month was released after two days of frantic meetings involving the main players in the ongoing internal wranglings. The organisation has been in turmoil since Mr Kennedy was criticised in an independent report into the sacking of former chief executive Howard Wells. The upheaval comes at a time when government funding for the redevelopment of Windsor Park stadium is at risk. Mr McCausland said on Thursday that he was ""absolutely confident"" funding would be made available for the upgrading of sports stadia in Northern Ireland.""We are now entering the next comprehensive spending review, that money is down there in the comprehensive spending review, I believe the executive will approve that,"" he said.""There is widespread support right across the parties for good stadia for football, for rugby and for gaelic.""When we get that money through the comprehensive spending review, we will know exactly what the level of funding will be for a replacement stadium and then football can look foward at international level to a much brighter future.""The resignations of the quartet from the IFA executive board left the executive committee with just five remaining members - one short of the minimum number required for decisions to be taken. Representatives of Premiership clubs met on Monday and it was indicated that there was ""unanimous agreement"" that Mr Kennedy and Mr Martin should quit their positions ""as soon as possible"".

A partial de-merger of the banks has since taken place.US officials said ABN had helped banks and individuals from countries including Iran and Libya channel money through the US banking system over a 10-year period.

What Europe can learn from the US,"The crisis in the euro area highlights two problems with a currency shared by states with their own taxing and spending powers. What happens if some of individual states fail to control their own finances? And what about a situation where their competitiveness diverges?The same questions arise, or could arise, with another large currency area, the United States. It has more individual units - 50 compared with the euro area's 16. That might make it even more unmanageable. But unlike in Europe, there is no talk of the currency union breaking apart. Why not? For one thing there is more discipline on the finances of the states. Nearly all have a legal or constitutional obligation to at least attempt to balance part of their budgets - though many can borrow for investment.  They do struggle sometimes, as California is now. It is certainly a political issue. But the shortfall is modest compared to the crisis facing some European states. The gap, which Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is trying to close, is $18bn (£12.4bn) for two years, about 0.5% of state income, its GDP. Then there is borrowing for investment which is also this year less than 1% of California's GDP.  For Greece, the total last year was 13.6%. So the US has a system of fiscal discipline - at state level that seems to be more effective than Europe's Stability and Growth Pact which tries, and has failed, to limit deficits to 3% of GDP. The US has another major advantage. The Federal budget has an important role in softening the impact of shocks that hit one state more than another. If one state is especially hit by economic events, its people pay less in federal taxes, and federal spending can be increased. Some of this happens automatically, especially on the tax side. And it can be augmented by deliberate policy decisions by the Federal government.  In Europe, the EU budget is too small for that effect to help very much. It is less than 1.5% of GDP. Public spending is dominated by the member states. In the US, Federal spending is about 15 times larger. Some European countries also have a problem with competitiveness. For a country with its own currency there is the option of allowing it to depreciate. But when you lose competitiveness against countries with the same currency it's no solution. That has happened in the Euro area. One measure of competitiveness is unit labour costs, which reflects changes in both workers pay and how much they produce.Between 2001 and 2008, according to OECD data, unit labour costs increased by more than 20% in Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland. In Germany they fell slightly and the average for the Euro as a whole was a more moderate increase of 12%. In the absence of a depreciation option, the only way of restoring competitiveness is lower pay and other costs. It can happen but it is hard to achieve and can easily lead to the kind of strife now hitting Greece.Of course the US does have internal differences in competitiveness, but workers are more ready to move - the single language helps of course - and pay cuts aren't quite so hard for employers to impose. Differences do persist, but there are features of the country's labour market that act as a kind of shock absorber.  What the Euro crisis has underlined is the difficulty of a single currency in the absence of a closer political union and more flexible labour markets. It may be possible to fix those problems. But it will take years. ",What Europe can learn from the US,0
Unseen John Lennon picture shown at Leamington gallery,"A Warwickshire exhibition includes an image of Yoko Ono and John Lennon which has not been seen in public before, a photographer says. The image, showing Lennon cuddling his new wife at a Top of the Pops rehearsal in 1970, was unveiled at Gallery 150 in Leamington Spa. It is part an exhibition by Bill Zygmant, who was a Fleet Street photographer in the 1960s, 70s and 80s. The exhibition will run until 10 September. Mr Zygmant, who is famous for taking images of The Beatles, said it was evident from photographing the couple that they had been devoted to each other. ""I was the only photographer at the Top of the Pops studios and I was very lucky to get the shot,"" he said. ""It was all quite rushed and I did not realise at the time how special it would be."" The photo was taken on 11 February, 1970, when Lennon was recording Instant Karma! (We all shine on) for transmission the next day. Mr Zygmant, of Rugby, said other pictures from the photography session had been published, but this one was among many exclusive photos he had found in his bag of negatives. He first took Lennon's picture in 1964 when he joked with the singer that he was earning more than him, with an income of £100 a week. Other unseen pictures at the Leamington show include a photo of Captain Sensible after he had released Happy Talk and a picture of Status Quo with all their roadies.

Greece brought to standstill by anti-austerity strike,"Thousands of Greeks have protested in the centre of the capital, Athens, as part of a general strike against government austerity measures. Demonstrators converged on the parliament building before dispersing.The 24-hour strike has seen schools closed and ferry and train services across the country halted.It was called in response to government moves to cut public sector wages and increase taxes.The Labour Ministry was occupied by communist protesters and rally organisers had hoped up to 100,000 people would join protests on the street. There were fears of renewed violence after protests in the city two weeks ago led to the deaths of three people when a bank was fire-bombed.But the crowds marching through Athens were smaller than those which took part in that general strike, reports the BBC's Malcolm Brabant from the Greek capital.Lines of riot police stood guard at vulnerable points near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to deter protesters from trying to storm the parliament building. Many Greeks are angered by the spending cuts and tax and pension-age rises planned in return for a 110bn-euro (£95bn) bail-out from the EU and IMF. The measures aim to achieve billions of euros in budget cuts over three years, with the goal of cutting Greece's public deficit to less than 3% of GDP by 2014. It currently stands at 13.6%. The strike officially began at midnight on Wednesday local time.Train services, shipping and domestic flights were severely disrupted.The strike was also expected to force the closure of government buildings, schools and banks, and to reduce hospitals to emergency staff later in the day.The country's main civil service and public sector unions say they represent some 2.5 million workers. ""People are bleeding financially but they will participate in the strike,"" Ilias Vrettakos, a senior member of the ADEDY union, was quoted as saying by Reuters.However, Greek air traffic controllers are not taking part in the industrial action. They have decided to continue working because travellers have faced too much disruption recently from the Icelandic volcano and also because of concerns about the impact of the strike on tourism, says our correspondent.He adds that journalists have also decided to postpone their industrial action, because one of the most essential components of this rolling campaign is publicity. The strike on 5 May in Athens generated some of the worst violence in decades.The death of three bank workers, who suffocated when their office was fire-bombed, has forced many people to question the way protests have been mounted, our correspondent says.He adds that the demonstrations during this latest strike will be a barometer of the mood of the nation.",Greece brought to standstill by anti-austerity strike,0

Czech abstract artist sees Belfast dream come true,"A chance glance at an advertisement in a job centre in the Czech Republic sent artist Tibor Cervenak on a journey that would change his life.He answered the call for cleaners  in October 2004 when his country joined the European Union and he could work abroad.He ended up in Belfast on 12-hour shifts with a cleaning company. From there, he drove taxis, doing ""crazy hours"" across the city.But he had his dream. He was always painting pictures in his head.And when this abstract artist got a chance to exhibit his work, he sold the lot - all 25 paintings - in 10 days and forged a name for himself that helped put the taxi keys at the back of the shelf.Now, Tibor Cervenak is about to open a studio on Belfast's Lisburn Road and next year, he will be travelling to New York to fulfil a lifelong ambition to exhibit there.""I was among the first group to come to Belfast after my country joined the EU,"" said Tibor.""I found an ad from a cleaning company and I saw the opportunity.""""When I first arrived, it was very difficult. This was a different world. I saw that it could be very aggressive and yet the people were so friendly. I was very confused. I was shocked at the stories on the news. So I just stopped watching it.""The early days were spent working 12-hours shifts, night and day, and living in one room in a house shared with other immigrants in the university area.But he had his painting. From the age of nine, he had developed a passion for painting and by his early 20s, he had exhibited in Europe and appeared in a documentary on Czech television.""I don't paint the subject. I work with the canvas as a composer,"" he explained.His dream was to open his own gallery and he worked as a taxi driver to fund that dream.A visit to Amsterdam where he saw the open artist studios, convinced him that this was his ideal.

America's royal wedding,"For many Americans, the young Ms Clinton who married her long-time beau Marc Mezvinsky on Saturday is in no need of her famous surname. She's just Chelsea.To her doting father, she's always been the centre of the universe. She ordered him to lose 15 pounds (7kg) before walking her down the aisle, and he unquestioningly complied. Before the event, the former president told another first daughter, Jenna Bush, that he would be both proud and wistful at the wedding, thinking about the day Chelsea was born and her first day of school.""I just hope I can keep it together,"" he said. For the equally adoring MOTB - that's Mother of The Bride, in case you didn't realise, and it's the acronym the Secretary of State has adopted - dress fittings and cake tastings have taken priority on a calendar that included meetings on Mid-East peace. But to the American public, Chelsea is the girl that grew up before their eyes, and they want a piece of the action. Ever since she appeared on the White House steps in 1993 as a typically gawky 12-year-old, Americans have eagerly dissected every small tidbit that managed to slip through her parentally constructed media shield.  Whether she likes it or not, the publicity-shy only child is a household name. Carl Anthony, an author and historian at the National First Ladies Library, says that Americans have been interested in Chelsea's wedding because she is part of the national narrative. ""It's a reflection of ourselves I think. It's this sense of a public event and these public people that we have sense of familiarity with,"" Mr Anthony says.""In Europe with its history of royal families, you've always had this. You've had national stories or national narratives."" For Americans, the Clintons fulfil that role.A wedding is a turning point in a universally recognised life narrative, which is why Chelsea's nuptials have garnered more attention than her graduations from Stanford and Oxford or her post 9/11 essay in Talk magazine. Chelsea's wedding has generated more interest than, for example, Jenna Bush's wedding in 2008, because she became part of the country's history at such a young age.Moreover, the Clintons are icons of a different, seemingly more youthful time in America's history - a pre 9/11 era when the country wasn't weighed down with wars, bulging deficits and billowing oil leaks. Chelsea is a reminder of that time, and people feel invested in the life of that young girl who held her parents hands through their darkest personal days. But, as Mr Anthony points out, despite her familiarity, people don't really know her. ""It's been 10 years since the Clintons left the White House and she's not in any way chosen or indicated a preference for a high-visibility public role. She's a grad school student,"" he told the BBC. ""It's not about her, it's about her parents.""And therein lies the problem with Chelsea's desire for nuptial privacy. The Clintons and their personal lives have long been magnets for the media, and despite their efforts, details of the wedding set the blogosphere alight.The 400 invitees were hosted at an estate in the Hudson River town of Rhinebeck, New York. Rumours have abounded that the cost of the wedding was between $3m and $5m (£1.9m - £3.2m).Aerial photographs which showed a large marquee being erected on the property of the Astor Courts Estate  made their way onto gossip blogs.That of course raised the inevitable question: where would guests relieve themselves? Apparently in classy porcelain portaloos, which cost around $15,000 to rent. One New York website called the loos ""nicer than your apartment"". For months, style watchers presumed that Chelsea would wear one of her mother's favourite designers, Oscar de la Renta. But this week she was snapped entering a Vera Wang store in Manhattan, attempting to hide her face under an oversized floppy hat - and she wore a strapless white gown by the designer on the day.The airspace over Rhinebeck was declared a ""no-fly zone"" on the afternoon of the wedding, further hampering the pesky paparazzi's ability to get that coveted shot.But mostly, the wedding details were overshadowed by debates over the guest list - specifically which of Bill and Hillary's celebrity pals would make the cut.President Obama ended speculation that he would attend by telling the ladies of US talk show The View that he didn't receive an invitation.Famous friends like Oprah Winfrey or Barbra Streisand were reported to be among those attending, but the Clintons had carefully clarified that each of the 400 guests must have a personal connection to the bride and groom.In typical Washington fashion, that sensible decree did not prevent griping from political contacts hoping that campaign generosity also buys a ticket to the A-list. ""I'm good enough to borrow a plane from, but not good enough to be invited to the wedding?"" an anonymous political donor grumbled to the New York Times. It's a quintessentially Washington mindset that conflates social and political power, access to which can often be bought.That's a world that Chelsea has rejected. The politics of her wedding are the politics of any wedding writ large.In the run-up, Chelsea had to grapple with questions that most brides do: how many people does the bride's family get to invite? What about the groom? How do I choose bridesmaids without causing hurt feelings? How big a secret do I keep the dress? But when your parents are Bill and Hillary Clinton those questions take on a new level of meaning. Chelsea didn't have a choice about that, or how many details of the wedding leaked. But these days, one thing she has control over is what people know about her.""What we perceive as secrecy about the wedding is really just privacy,"" Mr Anthony says.

""It is too soon to declare victory, but the improvement in the quarter is testament to the actions of our management team since we identified the problems in the US consumer finance market.""Pre-tax profits in Hong Kong and the Asia Pacific region were ""encouragingly higher"" in the three months to March, compared with the same quarter last year, he said.",HSBC: Bad debts fall as US operation returns to profit,0
Enron play to close on Broadway,"A British play about the collapse of Enron is to close on Broadway after just 15 performances and 22 previews.It is thought the show, which is ending on Sunday, is folding with a loss of up to $4m (£2.6m). Lucy Prebble's production premiered at the Chichester Festival Theatre last year to good reviews, before later moving to the West End.But when it opened in New York last month, the critics were unenthusiastic.It failed to receive any nods in the main categories such as best play.Despite positive reviews in the UK, the US critics did not share in their praise of the production, which was shown at the Broadhurst Theater.Ben Brantley of The New York Times called it a ""flashy but laboured economics lesson"".

Universities under pressure to pay living wage,"London universities are under pressure from students and community groups to support a campaign to pay cleaners a ""living wage"".Six universities in the capital now back a living wage of £7.60 per hour.King's College is set for talks with campaigners next week - while University College London says it has ""no plans"" to adopt the living wage.Students say the gap between high-paid university bosses and low-paid cleaners is ""shocking"".A cleaner on the minimum wage of £5.80, working 40-hours a week, 52 weeks a year, would have to work more than 33 years to earn the annual pay package of the provost of University College London.The University of London Union and London Citizens are campaigning for the living wage of £7.60 per hour to be paid to cleaners in universities in the capital.They say that the living wage is the threshold that is needed to survive in an expensive city such as London - and is higher than the legal minimum.It has been adopted by the London School of Economics, Birkbeck, the School of Oriental and African Studies, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Queen Mary.Goldsmiths says it is introducing the living wage when it renews its cleaning contract.King's College says it is about to hold an ""initial meeting"" with the students and representatives of London Citizens.But University College London says it has ""no plans to join the London Living Wage Campaign"".It says it pays its own directly-employed staff above the living wage, but this does not apply to cleaners who are hired through another company.""UCL considers itself a fair employer and benchmarks its rates of pay and conditions of employment against competitor organisations, in relation to which they are attractive,"" says the university.The university's president and provost, Malcolm Grant, is among the best paid university leaders in the UK.UCL says he was paid £303,492 in 2008-09 - with pension and benefits the total was £404,742.Students have contrasted the high levels of pay for the senior staff in universities with a reluctance to pay more for low-paid staff.A report earlier this year found that 19 university heads were earning more than £300,000.""For publicly-funded organisations there is an additional responsibility to have some kind of conscience,"" says ULU's vice president, Mazdak Alizadeh.""There is a clear parallel between high pay at the top and low pay at the bottom.""Those at the bottom should have enough to get by and not to have to live and work in poverty,"" he said.Describing the pay gap as ""shocking"", he said: ""It can't be justified to pay so much at the top when people who work for you are struggling to feed their families.""The living wage campaigners say that low pay condemns workers to a grinding life of poverty, many having to do two or three jobs, with limited time to see their own families.An election event organised by the Citizens UK community group - and promoters of the living wage - was addressed on Monday by leaders of the three biggest political parties.They heard the testimony of 14-year-old Tiari Sanchez who described the difficulties of a family trying to survive on her mother's income as a cleaner.She broke down in tears and was comforted by Labour leader Gordon Brown as she described the lack of money for the basics of food and travel.Her mother, who worked as a cleaner at the Treasury, had to leave home at 3.30am because she could not afford to travel there by tube.""If they were paying a living wage, my mum could afford the tube and I would see her for three hours more every day,"" she told the meeting.",Universities under pressure to pay living wage,0
The scene from the post-election trading floor,"Static and crackle, squawk boxes and coarse tones were the soundtrack to dealings in currencies and government bonds. But which way to trade? For weeks, the traders here have been betting on a Conservative victory. But the movements on the screens - tentative and nervous - initially mirrored the voters' lack of direction.Investors hate uncertainty, and these people are worried that a hung parliament will mean a government unwilling to make tough choices and upset an electorate that barely wanted it.Mainly, they fear that a weak government will be unable to force through measures to reduce the UK's high borrowing levels.As the morning wore on, traders took the view that such an outcome was likely. The interest rate that their market charges for UK government bonds - gilts - went up, while the lack of confidence took the pound down to a one-year low against the dollar.Piling on the pressure, the guidance from elsewhere for Friday's business was shaky in the extreme. Seismic downwards movements on the US markets -  virtually unseen in living memory - gave no strong lead to follow. Many think the 9% plunge the Dow Jones reached in Thursday's session was a slip of the finger, rather than a sign the market had glimpsed the apocalypse.And underpinning it all, as usual, was the theme of Greek debt woes and the knock-on fear of a euro break-up.European leaders are trying to agree the final details of of a 110bn-euro ($139bn; £86bn) loan package to Greece.On Friday, the cost of Greek and Portuguese government debt continued to rise, suggesting that investors remain unconvinced by the proposed rescue plan.In London, traders in currencies and bonds began their day at 0100 in a special trading session they hoped would let them steal a march on the election result. With far more to worry about than domestic concerns this morning, they were greeted by an uncertain sky, tending to the grey - as apt a description of the outlook for the financial climate as it is for the weather.

She is currently being treated in the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases in Bath, which has a unit specialising in rehabilitating brain injured people.Her sons Andrew Gay, who was 15 at the time of the crash, and Ryan Gay, 13, also suffered serious injuries but have since largely recovered.Mrs Last was taking the boys to school in Corsham when the accident occurred.Paramedics called to the scene said they had never come across a scene of such devastation.Kinsella, an event rider, admitted dangerous driving and driving with excess alcohol.His solicitor told the court that his client was ""full of remorse"" for the crash on 30 March.",Drink-drive man jailed over crash in Wiltshire,0
Historic farmhouse Llwyn Celyn to be holiday let,"It may not look like much now, but this in-need-of-attention property is set to be a holiday let for history fans.The Landmark Trust has funding for Llwyn Celyn farmhouse in Monmouthshire, with the aim of restoring its 500-plus years of architectural legacy.The Grade 1 Listed medieval hall house is considered the most significant inhabited ""at risk"" building in Wales. Welsh heritage body Cadw and the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) gave grants totalling £670,000.Thought to date from around 1480, the property is said to represent key developments in Welsh architecture between the 15th and 18th Centuries and a textbook example of the development of the British manor house. Largely untouched for the past century, the house is in more than six acres (2.6 hectares) of ground, near Llanvihangel Crucorney in the Llanthony Valley, and still has smoke-blackened roofs from its early years - the chimneys and floors were added in the 17th Century.Jennifer Stewart, of the NHMF, said the aim of the work was to ""build up the story and the story book of who lived in the property at different stages"".She said: ""Because it has been in private hands for 100 years, we really don't know that much about it.""Unlike modern houses, we don't know what is behind the panelling. We want to see what this house is like inside and what it was like to live in this house. There's a huge amount to be discovered there.""However, it is thought that the original owner must have been someone of considerable status and wealth and there is possibly a connection with Llanthony Priory which is situated less than six miles away.The Landmark Trust is to begin fundraising for the restoration and the house, which sits within the Brecon Beacons National Park, will be available for rent as holiday accommodation.Ms Stewart added: ""Often the way to preserve [buildings like this] is to find them a use. This is an other way to find a modern use for an ancient building. ""This is helping the building to ""breathe"" if you like. If people have enjoyed their stay, they may well provide additional funds.""Peter Pearce, director of the Landmark Trust, said: ""The importance of Llwyn Celyn in helping us understand the development of high status Welsh houses more fully cannot be understated.""",Historic farmhouse Llwyn Celyn to be holiday let,0
Carbon monoxide suspected as two teenagers found dead,"Two 18-year-olds have died following a suspected carbon monoxide leak in Castlerock, County Londonderry.  Another boy was taken from the holiday apartment at Tunnel Brae Court to the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine where he is said to be in a stable condition. It is thought a relative of one of the young men raised the alarm at about 2130 BST on Tuesday after phoning him. The boys who died were Aaron Davidson, of Fernagh Road, and Neil McFerran, of Kings Walk, both in Newtownabbey. It is understood that Aaron was awaiting his A-level results and Neil his A/S-level results.Health and safety officials have been checking gas appliances inside the flat to trace a leak, and the apartment block has been evacuated while tests continue. John McPoland from the Ambulance Service said: ""All the signs and symptoms were that it was carbon monoxide poisoning. ""When the Fire Service arrived, they used some of their equipment and they confirmed to the paramedics that there were high levels of carbon monoxide in the room.""Mr McPoland said it was too soon to determine the source of the carbon monoxide. ""The thing about carbon monoxide poisoning is that the carbon monoxide itself is odourless, colourless, tasteless so it's a silent killer,"" he said. ""You wouldn't know what's actually happening. You would just become very tired, weak and disorientated.""On Wednesday, the headmaster of the teenagers' school, Glengormley High, said they were role models for fellow pupils.Principal Lex Hayes said: ""Both boys had displayed exceptional talents in their careers here and were popular and valued by both students and staff.  ""Aaron and Neil were both prefects and acted as role models for younger pupils. They will be sadly missed by all who knew them in school.""Neil McFerran was a pupil at Monkstown Community School for five years, before changing schools to complete his A-levels. Andy Conn, one of his teachers, said his death had left the school ""stunned"".""He would have been in the school plays, involved in the youth club. ""He would have been a really popular, lively, well thought of boy,"" Mr Conn said.The Mayor of Newtownabbey, Alderman Paula Bradley, said she was ""devastated"" to hear of the teenagers' deaths.""As a mother of an 18-year-old son, it is all the more hard-hitting,"" she said.

"Music tuition falling, poll suggests","Fewer children are learning to play a musical instrument than in their parents' generation, a survey suggests.One third of children play a musical instrument compared with two thirds of their parents at the same age, research for BBC Worldwide found.And just 44% of the 1,046 parents questioned said it was important for their child to be involved in music.However, other figures suggest the number of pupils learning instruments has risen over the past decade.The most popular instruments for children are the guitar, the keyboard and the recorder.Boys are most likely to learn the guitar (17%), the keyboard (8%) and the drums (7%), while girls are more likely to choose the recorder (11%), followed by the guitar, piano and keyboard (all 9%).The survey, of 1,046 parents with children aged 18 and under, was carried out for BBC Worldwide.It found 64% of children did not play a musical instrument.Among the parents themselves, 34% said they had not played an instrument as a child.The eldest child in a family is the most likely to play an instrument, the research suggests.The UK survey, carried out by ICM, was commissioned in connection with the BBC TV children's music show Zingzillas.Stephanie Cooper, editor of Zingzillas magazine, said: ""As this research shows, fewer children are now learning musical instruments and parents may not be aware of just how beneficial music can be to a child's development.""Young children love responding to music by dancing, singing, creating pictures or talking about what they hear, which gives them creative confidence.""Hearing musical rhythms, patterns and sounds is beneficial for early literacy learning."" Fiona Harvey, education consultant for the Association of British Orchestras, said: ""I find it surprising that these results have come about.""Other research about children learning instruments has suggested that at least 50% of children have learned or are currently learning an instrument.""Opportunities are out there. Perhaps if they [the children in the survey] had an opportunity to learn, they might not have continued. Also, there are lots of informal ways of learning music.""A study by the Institute of Education carried out in England in 2005 found just over 8% of pupils between the ages of five and 16 were learning an instrument in state schools.Among juniors (aged seven to 11) 13% were receiving tuition, researchers found.  Numbers had risen since the early 80s, they said.In 2004, the then Labour government launched a ""music manifesto"", which included the pledge to give every child in England the chance of free or cut-price instrument tuition. A scheme called Wider Opportunities was rolled out in 6,500 schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland which involved children learning to play instruments as a class for free. Fiona Harvey said this had been a ""fantastic initiative"". According to figures provided by the Federation of Music Services, the number of pupils learning an instrument has risen from less than half a million in 2002 to a predicted 2.1m next year.The statistics on musical tuition in independent schools were higher, she added.ICM Research polled 1,046 parents of children aged 18 and under online between 25-30 August.","Music tuition falling, poll suggests",0
Lifeboatman in false disability benefit fraud claim,"A man has been prosecuted for claiming disability benefits while working as a member of a North Sea lifeboat crew. Mason Bentley, 34, of Thornton-le-Dale, Pickering, was with the Flamborough Lifeboat for a year from October 2006.He received a top RNLI bravery award for rescuing a swimmer in bad weather, Bridlington magistrates heard.But Bentley admitted he was claiming Disability Living Allowance at the same time. Last Friday, he was ordered to repay false benefit claims of £9,942. Magistrates also gave him a six-month curfew order, between 10pm and 10am, and ordered him to pay costs of £70.Bentley, also known as Alistair Docherty, formerly of Ogle Road, Flamborough, pleaded guilty on 3 September to failing to notify a change of circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefits. He admitted claiming disability living allowance between 6 December 2006 and 14 April 2009.In 2008, he was among a three-man crew which was given the RNLI's top award for the most daring rescue of the year. The mission on 22 August 2007 involved rescuing a swimmer in ""dreadful conditions"" close to rocks off Flamborough Head.Commenting on the conviction, an RNLI spokesman said: ""Alistair Docherty, as he was known to the RNLI, was a volunteer crew member at Flamborough for only a year and we have had no contact with him for two years.

Mark, JerseyMy favourite toys were my Polly Pocket and my Postman Pat play village. I always wanted a Gameboy but my mother wouldn't allow it.

Durham cricket club passes to India media moguls' hands,"On the pitch Durham are going about a spirited defence of their status as county champions.At the club's Riverside ground Liam Plunkett is running in with some hostility to his bowling. Ian Blackwell is bringing new meaning to the word ""yeomanlike"" with his batting and bowling, and in spite of the north-eastern chill crowds are being counted in their hundreds. But behind the playing scene there are big financial changes going on at the game's newest first-class county. Quietly and without publicity the club has passed into foreign hands.Durham is now more than 90% owned by the Indian media figure Gautam Radia and his brother Hiren. Their stake cost them just short of £2.5m.According to Durham's chief executive David Harker the two are associates of the club's chairman Clive Leach - a former media man himself - and apparently little more than sleeping investors.""They tend not to take a day-to-day interest in the running of the club,"" says Mr Harker.""They don't participate in board meetings. But they are people who have the means, who have an interest in cricket and people who believe in the future of Durham and the future of the stadium.""Mr Harker is also keen to point out that the brothers and Durham have a relationship that goes back to 2008, even if their investment has only now been made public. However, that investment is starting to look rather canny, given Durham's plans to participate in a new domestic 20 over competition. The blueprint is India's Premier League, 20 frenetic overs a side and immensely popular.Durham is part of a group of counties, who own Test match venues, currently examining the structure of county cricket and exploring the prospect of a new Twenty20 tournament - a tournament that could be a big revenue earner.Eight teams would participate on a regional basis. The most likely make-up of a side would have seven home-grown players and four overseas players, most likely Indian - so the rights to the games would be attractive to that country's television broadcasters.It's believed the eight sides would retain a 51% stake in a new franchise. The other 49% would be sold. And anyone buying in would make their money from those Indian TV rights.A previous proposal suggested that each franchise could be sold for £50m, and the tournament could generate £85m when sponsorship, broadcasting and match-day receipts are totted up. Such figures (albeit formulated before the recession took hold) would revolutionise the finances of the clubs involved. In Durham's case it could pave the way to a stock market flotation.""Ultimately that would be something that would be interesting,"" says Mr Harker.""Now there's a lot of work to be done before we ever get to that stage. And we're very much aware of where other organisations have perhaps tried and not gone down that route.""But he says that giving the local community the opportunity to have a stake in the Durham cricket business, when it was fully developed, was something ""very much in the front of our minds"".A flotation would also allow the two Indian investors a profitable exit route.That's for the future though. At the moment Durham are trying to bring in more investment from their own patch. They've already wooed local stockbroker Brewin Dolphin into a  lucrative shirt sponsorship deal.But it needs more. Riverside needs to be developed out to a 20,000 capacity, as an Ashes Test in 2013 is looming. But so too it seems are big financial changes.",Durham cricket club passes to India media moguls' hands,0

Twenty minutes with Courtney Love,"At the back of your mind, when you set off to interview Courtney Love,  you're secretly hoping she'll do something weird - like taking off her trousers, apropos of nothing, in the middle of the interview. But it's still a surprise when she actually does it.The moment comes towards the end of our 20-minute chat, as the rock star describes how she sold her house to Paul McCartney (""I cleared my CD room of anything Beatle-esque,"" she notes).The story reminds her that there's a new pair of Stella McCartney sequinned black hipster trousers hanging up in her dressing room - and she immediately decides to try them on. ""You're going to see my ass,"" she announces, stripping off in front of a full-length mirror - but the trousers do not meet with her approval. ""Too much ass-crack,"" she sighs.We are backstage at the Brixton Academy, where Love's band Hole are about to play the second date of a brief UK tour, in support of their new album, Nobody's Daughter.It's the band's first record since 1998's million-selling Celebrity Skin (although, with Love the only founding member of group left, the name is purely a brand at this point).Mellower than previous Hole records, it has a Fleetwood Mac, soft-rock sheen to the production. But the lyrics, and Love's raw vocals, give it much sharper teeth than that description suggests.""You stabbed your heel on broken glass,"" she spits with seething vengeance on the single, Skinny Little Bitch, ""so I could kick your scrawny ass.""The tour started in Glasgow two days ago, and Love is still fired up by the  response.""It was awesome,"" she rasps delightedly. ""I played three-and-a-half hours! I had all the house lights on!""""The band didn't know [the song] Boys On The Radio from Celebrity Skin, so the whole audience was singing it a capella.""And then, I don't tend to look at reviews unless it's the New York Times or the London Times but I had to Google something and I saw that some small Glaswegian newspaper had slated us. ""There were something like three, maybe four-hundred responses and every one of them was like, 'were you even at the same show?' ""It was so funny, I was laughing so hard. It was like this guy didn't even stay to the end. ""You could not fault that show,"" she rounds off, barely having paused for breath. ""It was amazing.""These are the edited highlights, by the way. Love's description of the gig lasts an entire ten minutes.  In passing, she describes the flights she took to Glasgow, blames Fred Durst for ""ushering in the worst era of rock and roll in history"", and vividly describes her ""mojo"".It is a pure stream of consciousness. No thought, however trifling, remains unspoken. But there is something beguiling about her filthy humour and scattershot enthusiasm. At one point she disappears into a side-room to fetch a Versace couture dress. ""I had this made for the 1996 Oscars,"" she says. ""I always thought I'd get married in it one day but, well...""Although the singer has talked, in frank detail, about her love life in the past, claiming liasions with rock legends like Trent Reznor, Billy Corgan and... er, Bush's Gavin Rossdale, she isn't so forthcoming today.All she will reveal, mysteriously, is that she is ""waiting for a text from a boy"".She is more effusive when I ask about the cover of her new album. Love grabs my copy of the CD and begins a whistle-stop tour of the artwork.""I had Disney make me these shoes, these broken glass slippers,"" she says, pointing at the inside cover, ""and this is a ship at sea that's sinking - which is how I felt making the record. ""This picture is when I was very skinny - I'm almost six feet tall and at this point I'm about 101lbs. No drugs, just total neuroses making this record.""And what about the pictures of Marie Antoinette, Anne Boleyn and Lady Jane Grey? ""The art is pretty-self evident,"" she replies. ""We always seem to get rid of the good dames.""Love is keen to align herself to these historical figures. Strong, misunderstood women, all of whom met a grisly end.She has had her fair share of tough times - from the suicide of her husband Kurt Cobain in 1994, to losing custody of her daughter Frances Bean last year - but she is not ready to give up the fight just yet.The 45-year-old says she has been sober for ""seven years"" and  currently only takes prescription medications.

AIG returns to profit thanks to investment arm,"AIG has returned to profit in the first quarter of 2010, thanks to an improved income from its investments.The firm, which is nearly 80% owned by the US government, made $1.5bn (£1bn) in the period, compared with a loss of $4.4bn a year earlier.But it said tough economic conditions meant its insurance business continued to struggle.AIG shares rose by 3.2% in pre-market trading on Friday.""I am pleased with their progress, but there is still more work to be done,"" said chief executive Robert Benmosche.The firm has agreed to sell two major foreign businesses to bolster its finances and put it in a position to repay some of the $183bn in government loans it received in its taxpayer-funded bailout.But AIG's plans to sell its Asian business AIA to UK group Prudential for $35.5bn hit a snag after the Pru delayed a rights issue to fund the purchase.In the other deal, MetLife is paying $6.8bn in cash and $8.7bn in shares for American Life Insurance Company (Alico), which operates in more than 50 countries.",AIG returns to profit thanks to investment arm,0

iPad global launch date confirmed by Apple,"Apple has announced that its iPad tablet computer will go on sale in nine countries outside the US on 28 May.The new markets are Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the UK.The cheapest model will retail at £429 in the UK. The same version in the US costs $499 (£337). Part of the difference in price is due to British VAT and US sales tax. The same model before tax costs £37 ($55) more in the UK.The consumer gadget was launched in the US domestic market on 3 April, but Apple had to delay deliveries to international consumers.Apple says that since the device went on sale it has already sold more than 1m iPads in the US.In the UK, the device will range in price from £429 for the entry-level model, to £699 for the maximum capacity 64GB model, which also has built-in access to third-generation (3G) mobile networks.Customers will be able to pre-order the device in the different markets from 10 May. Many other companies, including Dell, Nokia and Toshiba, are planning to release tablet computers in 2010. On 4 May, Intel unveiled the family of chips it hopes will be used in tablet computers that will go on sale towards the end of the year. The international launch comes after a challenging month for Apple. In addition to iPad delivery delays, the US technology website Gizmodo published details of Apple's next generation iPhone.Apple is known for keeping product announcements secret.

Rugby side Scarlets' council loan repayment deferred,"Carmarthenshire council has agreed the Scarlets regional rugby side can defer interest it owes on a £2.4m loan for three years.The money was made available to the club to help its move to the new Parc y Scarlets stadium two years ago.The council said it would not cost it anything in the long-term as the interest would be rolled-on.The executive board also backed changes that would see the club's funding directors swap debt for new shares.The Scarlets lease the new ground from the county council which in return has to agree to any changes in its financial structure.At the club's recent AGM the funding directors agreed to swap almost £5m they were owed for new shares.Council executive board member Wynn Evans said: ""It is very much in the council's interest to grant consent for the proposals by the directors to go ahead.""This will see the club's overall debt decrease by £5m.""This will significantly strengthen the club financially and allow the directors to continue to work to make the club self-financing over the next three years.""Mr Evans said the executive board also agreed to defer part of the interest on the council loan which would be rolled up and become payable when the loan ends in 2023.He said it would have the effect of increasing the sum due to be paid by the club to the council from £2.4m to £2.6m.The council had originally offered to loan the Scarlets £2.6m but they only borrowed £2.4m.""It is important to stress that this will not be at a loss to the council taxpayer - the interest is merely deferred and will become payable upon repayment of the loan,"" he added.",Rugby side Scarlets' council loan repayment deferred,0

Angela Merkel eyes quick eurozone reform,"German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for an ""acceleration"" of efforts to regulate the finance sector in the eurozone.At a gathering of eurozone leaders in Brussels, she said there was ""no more time"" to reform market regulations.The meeting is being held to discuss how to prevent the Greek debt crisis from spreading.Mrs Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy say they want rules that limit government spending to be enforced.The pair added they were ""fully committed to preserve the solidity, stability and unity of the eurozone"".Speaking before the meeting, Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou stressed the importance of the summit.""The Greek people have endured the strain and the pain of the economic crisis during the last few months,"" he said.""At the same time there is unprecedented volatility throughout the world and the world economy. That is why today's meeting here in Brussels is so important.""Separately, finance ministers from the G7 group of nations have held a conference call to discuss Greece and the eurozone.And US President Barack Obama told Mrs Merkel by phone that he backed efforts to rescue Greece.""We agreed on the importance of a strong policy response by the affected countries and a strong financial response from the international community,"" President Obama said.

In a letter to France's Le Monde newspaper, Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy set out several initiatives to try to stabilise financial markets by forcing eurozone countries to take a tighter grip of their finances.The recommendations include:stricter monitoring of eurozone member debta financial sector bail-out fund paid for by banksa clampdown on credit rating agencies.The way that Greek finances suffered after ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded its government debt ""should make us think about the role of credit rating agencies in the propagation of a crisis"", the letter says.Also speaking ahead of the summit, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said he would do ""whatever necessary to ensure that financial markets are not a playground for speculation"".Meanwhile, monitoring European debt remains a hot topic after Greece's deficit surpassed 13% of its gross domestic product (GDP).As a condition of entering the eurozone, members are supposed to keep their public sector deficits under 3% of GDP.",Angela Merkel eyes quick eurozone reform,0
Peter Tobin questioned over sex crimes,"Serial killer Peter Tobin has been questioned by police in Edinburgh within the last 24 hours in connection with serious sex crimes in Scotland.The 63-year-old was taken from Saughton Prison in Edinburgh, where he is serving life sentences for the murders of three young women.He was questioned for more than 10 hours at St Leonards police station.Tobin was also quizzed about searches of two East Sussex properties, which failed to uncover any further victims.Teams of police officers and forensic archaeologists spent 15 days excavating the garden and basement of his former home in Brighton, but the search was halted on Monday after it revealed no evidence of any crimes.A nine-day search at a property in Portslade, which also ruled out a link to Tobin's crimes, ended last week.Tobin was first convicted of murder three years ago, when he was found guilty of raping and killing Polish student Angelika Kluk.The 23-year-old's body was found under the floor of St Patrick's Church in Glasgow, where Tobin had been working as a handyman.Detectives investigating the disappearances of 18-year-old Dinah McNicol and 15-year-old Vicky Hamilton focused their attention on Tobin after he was convicted of Angelika Kluk's murder.Ms McNicol vanished in August 1991 while hitchhiking to her home in Tillingham after leaving a music festival in Hampshire. Falkirk schoolgirl Vicky Hamilton disappeared the same year while waiting for a bus near Tobin's then home in Bathgate, West Lothian.Their bodies were found buried in the garden of Tobin's home in Margate, Kent, in 2008.Detectives involved in Operation Anagram, which is looking into the background of the serial killer from Johnstone in Renfrewshire, believe he could be responsible for the disappearance of many other young women, dating back to the 1960s.Strathclyde Police Supt David Swindle, who is leading the inquiry, said: ""As a result of the continuing enquiries surrounding Operation Anagram, Strathclyde officers detained Peter Tobin from HMP Edinburgh and took him to Saint Leonards Police Office, Edinburgh, where he was interviewed with a legal representative for most of the day.""This was in relation to his suspected involvement in serious sexual crimes in Scotland and also in an effort to establish the truth about the possible criminal activities of Peter Tobin which have been the subject of continued media speculation.""The outcome of yesterday's interview conducted under Scottish powers is being reported to the Crown Office in Scotland.""A Sussex officer attached to the UK wide Operation Anagram was present throughout the interview, this joint working between UK Forces has been a significant feature of Operation Anagram which still continues to examine the life of the serial killer Peter Tobin.""Tobin, who was returned to Saughton jail on Wednesday night, has always refused to help police investigating his crimes.Strathclyde Police said a report had been sent to the procurator fiscal.",Peter Tobin questioned over sex crimes,0

Stuart Semple collection inspired by 'mental' Britain,"He's been dubbed ""the Basquiat of the noughties"" and, with Sienna Miller and Debbie Harry among his fans, it's no wonder that Stuart Semple's star is rising.The contemporary artist opens his first major show in almost three years in London on 6 May. Inspired by consumerism and popular culture, the exhibition sees Semple more grown up, yet still politically charged. He likes to make a statement and his vibrant new collection of works certainly delivers. ""They are quite different from my other paintings,"" he tells the BBC. ""I hope that they maybe describe where we are as a culture at this moment in time.""Semple first achieved widespread notoriety for his memorial artwork RIP YBA (Young British Artists), which boxed up the debris of a fire at the Momart warehouse in east London - including works by Damien Hirst and Tracey Emin.A year later, he made headlines again when he sneaked a painting into the Saatchi Gallery to protest at the absence of British artists in its Triumph of Painting exhibition.""I thought, 'you've backed all these amazing artists who I really admired growing up, and now you're telling me they're no good... that's strange'. ""I wanted to make a piece about that and it ended up being quite performative.""By the age of 28, Semple was a millionaire - his name cropping up in conversation alongside Warhol and Jeff Koons. It's a heavy mantle to carry, but the fact that some of his works sell for up to £100,000 must make it easier to bear. ""When I was at art school in the '90s you didn't become an artist to make money,"" he protests. ""The kids who are coming out now - they've got a completely different agenda. They want to be famous and make money because they can see that's a viable career option.""An advocate of arts for the masses, Semple wants his work to be accessible. He's now collaborating with Amy Winehouse's manager, Ray Cosbert, to market himself in the same way as a pop star. He hopes the fusion of the two worlds will bring in new audiences. ""[My work] is inspired by music videos, television, the news. Things that are familiar to us - things we see every day,"" he says. ""We live in a place that's gloomy more than it's sunny. Ultimately, it's not the best place to live. It's actually quite mental and we're a bit eccentric. ""And all of those things together, I think, with this crazy history we've had probably make us do something a bit different.""The Happy House, An Exhibition Of New Paintings by Stuart Semple is on display at the Morton Metropolis Gallery in London until 28 May.

Why heads are breaking the rules on Sats,"This is the year that those who are used to setting the rules decided to break them.Those pillars of the community, the head teachers of England's primary schools, are rebelling against their own head - the government. The national schools tests in English and maths - known as Sats - are a cornerstone of England's primary education system.But this year children in hundreds, if not thousands, of schools will not take them. The raw results from these tests are used to make the primary school league tables, which are pored over by many parents and provide the bedrock on which schools are judged by Ofsted inspectors.Heads and deputies who voted for this boycott say the tests encourage teachers to follow a narrow curriculum, focusing on reading and writing, and exam technique at the expense of other subjects. But most of all, they want to take a sledgehammer to the league tables.These are drawn up by media organisations from the raw data released by the government.The heads say the tables humiliate schools and children and are not a true reflection of what either does.They think there should be national or area-by-area results instead. But the authorities see the tests as a key way of holding schools to account.Labour's Schools Secretary Ed Balls talked of the ""legal and moral duty"" heads have to stage the tests and his ""deep disappointment"" that they were to go ahead with the boycott.He said the tests had helped drive up primary school standards and were a vital indicator to parents of how their children and their local schools were performing.But talk of the government or councils taking legal sanctions against the heads did not turn into action. With the tests falling days after the most closely-fought general election for a generation, that is perhaps not surprising.It will be down to the new administration to deal with this classroom rebellion.And all three main parties are against the boycott.In the run up to the election, both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats said they would reform the tests -  but no-one was talking about scrapping the league tables - a key aim of the joint NAHT and NUT campaign.The unions say they are not against testing per se and suggest an alternative system where children are assessed by their teachers - with the results being checked externally.The NUT says there should be ""sampling"" of results across the country to give a picture of how children are doing nationally.Teachers in England already make formal assessments of their pupils, using the same scale as that used in the national tests.These ratings are submitted to the government and for the first time this year they will be published alongside the Sats results.The change came about after talks with the head teachers aimed at averting this industrial action.But it did not go far enough for the heads, who look at Wales and Northern Ireland, where Sats were abolished, and to Scotland which has never had them. The unions say they have been encouraged by the political parties' talk of reform - but only time will tell whether this will translate into a solution both sides can live with.

Boiler scrappage payout revealed by Energy Saving Trust,"All vouchers for England's boiler scrappage scheme have been claimed but less than half of the money has been paid out so far.All of the 125,000 vouchers that take £400 off the cost of replacing an old boiler with a new efficient one were claimed by 26 March.Some 58,177 people have received the £400 rebate after paying up-front to have the work done.A scheme is also operating in Wales and one will start in Scotland on 24 May.The boiler scrappage scheme was announced in the pre-Budget report and was aimed at kick-starting the industry, which had suffered during the recession.Households that had a G-rated boiler as the main boiler to heat their home were eligible to apply for a voucher to reduce the cost of an energy-efficient replacement.People then shopped around for quotes for the new boiler and sent details of their chosen installer and product to the Energy Saving Trust (EST).The EST would send a £400 voucher in return, but the householder needed to pay for the work up-front and then send the receipt and voucher to the EST. The money would then be put into their bank account.The EST has told the BBC that all vouchers were claimed by 125,000 households by 26 March.Of these, 97,283 have had the work completed and have sent in details to the EST.A spokesman said that the target was for people to get £400 put in their bank account within 25 working days of these details being received.So far, 58,177 have been paid the rebate, with the remainder being processed.Householders have a deadline of 12 weeks for the work to be completed from when the vouchers are sent out.More than 27,000 have yet to send in receipts for the work. The final vouchers were sent out about six weeks ago.""We are sympathetic to allowing a few days leniency after the 12 weeks,"" an EST spokesman said.Any vouchers that were returned unused would not be redistributed, he added. The scheme was now closed to new applications.On the odd occasion, some householders had seen their payments delayed because they submitted the wrong bank details, he said.The popularity of replacement boilers has been driven by the scrappage scheme, and also by the cold winter weather, according to British Gas owner Centrica.""The number of central heating systems installed was up around 20% on the same period last year, reflecting a more competitively priced product range and benefits from the government's boiler scrappage scheme,"" the company said in its interim management statement on Monday. ""However, the business experienced additional costs as a result of the higher incidence of boiler breakdown call-outs during the cold weather in the first quarter.""A scheme in Scotland, similar to the English scrappage scheme, will offer £400 vouchers to 5,000 households. It has been unveiled and will be open for applications from 24 May.In Wales, vouchers worth £500 have been available since 6 April. However, this is only open to those aged 60 and over in order to target those more vulnerable to fuel poverty.",Boiler scrappage payout revealed by Energy Saving Trust,0
UK interest rates kept at record low of 0.5%,"UK interest rates have been kept on hold at a record low of 0.5% by the Bank of England.The Bank also decided not to pump any more money into the UK economy under its policy of quantitative easing (QE).Interest rates have now been 0.5% since March 2009, and analysts do not expect any rate rises soon while the economy continues to recover.The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the first three months of this year, slower than the previous quarter.In the final three months of 2009, the economy grew by 0.4%.However, the 0.2% is a first estimate, which could be revised up, or down.The UK emerged from recession in the final quarter of last year, after six consecutive quarters of contraction.Although the UK inflation rate rose sharply to 3.4% in March from 3% the month before, most analysts believe interests rates will remain at 0.5% for a number of months to bolster the fragile economic recovery.""Given the dangers still facing the economy, the [Bank's] Monetary Policy Committee must persevere with expansionary policies,"" said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce.""Any thought of raising interest rates, and withdrawing the QE stimulus, must be rejected until there is more conclusive evidence that growth is secure.""The Institute of Directors said it ""made sense"" to keep rates on hold, particularly in light of the political uncertainty surrounding the formation of a new government.Last week's UK general election failed to give any party a clear majority, and the major parties are holding talks to try to form a coalition government.All parties have said they will cut spending to tackle the budget deficit, which means the Bank will have to keep rates low to compensate, analysts say.""I'm in no doubt that, whatever government is formed, a major fiscal squeeze looms and monetary policy will have to be kept exceptionally loose to compensate,"" said Roger Bootle, economic adviser to accountancy firm Deloitte.",UK interest rates kept at record low of 0.5%,0

""We need a system for the 21st Century that is suitable for our lifestyles"".And technology analyst Ovum has argued that problems at polling stations ""will lead to a reinvigorated push for e-voting"".It is unclear whether voter problems in the UK's general election actually impacted results in any of the seats where people were turned away.But some observers described the scenes as being reminiscent of the ""hanging chad"" controversy in the disputed US general election in Florida in 2000, which saw George W Bush controversially elected president.In the wake of that crisis, electronic voting is being introduced across the United States, in part to help prevent a repeat.And in India, the world's largest democracy has been using electronic voting across the entire country since the general election of 2004.Proponents argue that electronic voting is very quick for voters, helps to prevent spoiled ballots, and counts votes in an instant.And if the UK's polling problems were partially caused by slow voting, perhaps all those who were left out in the cold would have been able to vote had they had the option of doing it electronically.A spokesperson told BBC News that the Electoral Commission has been ""recommending that parliament should look at reforming the electoral system"" for some time.""Electronic voting is an issue that would be explored,"" she said.Since 2000, the British government has recommended that local authorities pilot a range of alternatives to the paper ballot.  In May 2007, five UK local authorities tried out electronic voting, including votes over the internet that could be registered from anywhere.But in a report assessing those pilots, the Electoral Commission found that there were ""issues with the security and transparency of the solutions and the capacity of the local authorities to maintain control over their elections"".The report added that ""A central process must be implemented to ensure that sufficiently secure and transparent e-voting solutions that have been tested and approved can be selected by local authorities.""There have long been security concerns around electronic voting machines.The BBC has previously reported on warnings from computer experts that early American machines were vulnerable to registering multiple votes from determined users.And there have recently been allegations that India's electronic voting machines are vulnerable to attack.But Andy Williamson, director of digital democracy at the non-partisan think tank, the Hansard Society, argues that ""a lack of desire to change"" is a better explanation of any resistance to electronic voting than security concerns.He acknowledges the risks with electronic voting, but says ""you have to put this in the context of the current process, which we mostly accept, despite the obvious flaws and risks.""  Those risks, he says, include ""the lack of positive voter verification, the obvious risk of moving big piles of paper around, and the fallibility of manual counting.""So what does a disenfranchised voter make of the idea of electronic voting?  Anna Sheldrake was unable to vote in Hackney, despite being at the polling station half an hour before closing time.""I'd be happy to vote electronically"", she said.  ""Sometimes I feel nervous about using the internet, but I would hope those introducing such a system would take care of the risk of fraud.""In the meantime, Ms Sheldrake offered a more traditional solution to the problem: ""Simply employ more people"".She said the polling station was not ready for the demand.""They should have been prepared for a 100% electorate turning up, and for it to be a democracy, everyone should have the right to vote.""",Chaotic polling problems lead to calls for e-voting,0
UK interest rates kept at record low of 0.5%,"UK interest rates have been kept on hold at a record low of 0.5% by the Bank of England.The Bank also decided not to pump any more money into the UK economy under its policy of quantitative easing (QE).Interest rates have now been 0.5% since March 2009, and analysts do not expect any rate rises soon while the economy continues to recover.The UK economy grew by 0.2% in the first three months of this year, slower than the previous quarter.In the final three months of 2009, the economy grew by 0.4%.However, the 0.2% is a first estimate, which could be revised up, or down.The UK emerged from recession in the final quarter of last year, after six consecutive quarters of contraction.Although the UK inflation rate rose sharply to 3.4% in March from 3% the month before, most analysts believe interests rates will remain at 0.5% for a number of months to bolster the fragile economic recovery.""Given the dangers still facing the economy, the [Bank's] Monetary Policy Committee must persevere with expansionary policies,"" said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce.""Any thought of raising interest rates, and withdrawing the QE stimulus, must be rejected until there is more conclusive evidence that growth is secure.""The Institute of Directors said it ""made sense"" to keep rates on hold, particularly in light of the political uncertainty surrounding the formation of a new government.Last week's UK general election failed to give any party a clear majority, and the major parties are holding talks to try to form a coalition government.All parties have said they will cut spending to tackle the budget deficit, which means the Bank will have to keep rates low to stimulate growth, analysts say.""I'm in no doubt that, whatever government is formed, a major fiscal squeeze looms and monetary policy will have to be kept exceptionally loose to compensate,"" said Roger Bootle, economic adviser to accountancy firm Deloitte.The UK base rate has been at 0.5% since March 2009, but the cost of borrowing for the public has fluctuated since then.Credit cards have become more expensive to use, with the average rate rising from 15.7% in March last year to 16.5% in March this year, as the recession has driven up the likelihood of borrowers defaulting.The average cost of an overdraft has also risen, from 18.6% to 19%.The cost of mortgage borrowing has been steadier. Two-year fixed-rate mortgages, with a 25% deposit, rose from 4% last March to 4.5% last September, but have subsided gently since then to stand at 3.9% in March this year.Borrowing at fixed rates for longer terms has become a bit more expensive though, with five-year fixed-rate mortgages with a 25% deposit jumping in June last year from 5% to 5.5% and hovering around that level ever since.Standard variable rates for home loans have been much more stable and currently stand at 4%.The ultra-low base rate has dragged down the interest payable on most people's savings. The average cash ISA offers 0.5% - the same as base rate itself - while branch-based instant access accounts offer even less - just 0.2%.However, the competition among banks and building societies to attract some saver's money has contrived to push back up the interest rates on offer to people whose branch accounts require some notice before a withdrawal.They have gone up from 0.2% to 0.5%.",UK interest rates kept at record low of 0.5%,0
Police boss who tackled Scotland Yard corruption dies,"Sir Robert Mark, the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner who famously tackled police corruption, has died aged 93. Current commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson said Sir Robert was a man of the highest integrity and remained a role model to police officers. Sir Robert's crackdown from 1972 saw 450 Scotland Yard officers leave over disciplinary proceedings. He pioneered closer media relations and increased debate about policing. When Sir Robert took over, morale in the force was low. At one stage Sir Robert, who lived in Esher, Surrey, threatened to put all 3,200 officers in the CID back into uniform and start again from scratch unless they conformed to his standards.Born in Manchester the son of a clothing manufacturer, Sir Robert joined the police in 1937.  In 1957 he became the youngest chief constable in Britain when, at the age of 40, he was appointed to Leicester. His innovations as Met commissioner included intensifying the investigation of complaints from the public.  He was particularly successful in combating IRA and other terrorism.  In 1975, Sir Robert won considerable credit for the successful tactics adopted by the police in the Spaghetti House siege in Knightsbridge, where three gunmen eventually surrendered after holding six hostages in a restaurant cellar.  Sir Robert retired on his 60th birthday. He then began lecturing and acted as a security consultant. He also made a number of television commercials for a famous tyre firm and, for some time, gave all the money he made from them to charity.",Police boss who tackled Scotland Yard corruption dies,0
"RBS planning to cut 2,600 UK jobs","Royal Bank of Scotland has said it is to cut a further 2,600 UK jobs over the next year. Most of the losses are in its insurance division, with 600 posts going at the head office of its retail banking arm.The bank has been trying to cut costs since the massive government bail-out to save it from collapse in 2007, which left RBS 84%-owned by the taxpayer.It had already announced almost 20,000 job losses across its business worldwide since the bail-out.As part of the overall cuts, some 500 workers stand to lose their jobs in Edinburgh and Glasgow, according to the Scottish government.RBS said it would try to keep compulsory redundancies to an ""absolute minimum"".""We are working hard to rebuild RBS in order to repay taxpayers for their support and having to cut jobs is the most difficult part of this process,"" it added.""We have strived at all times to be open and honest about the tough choices we are making."" RBS's insurance arm includes the Direct Line, Green Flag, Churchill and Privilege businesses and employs 16,000 people.The retail banking roles will mainly be cut from headquarters in Edinburgh and London.As part of its bail out, RBS is to sell some of its businesses, including its branches in England and Wales - originally Williams &amp; Glyn's - its NatWest brand in Scotland, RBS Insurance and Global Merchant Services, its card payment business. The sales have been demanded by the European Commission to safeguard competition concerns after RBS received the state aid.","RBS planning to cut 2,600 UK jobs",0
Wylfa nuclear plant to operate for two more years,"Wylfa nuclear power plant on Anglesey is to continue generating electricity for around another two years, say industry regulators.The Magnox-type reactors were due to shut down in December after 39 years.The extension of the plant's lifespan secures 200 jobs, while there are still hopes of a new plant being built nearby within 10 years.An agreement on the extension was agreed with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).Nick Gore, Wylfa site director, said: ""I'm absolutely delighted with the news.""It is a reflection of the hard work put in by our experienced staff in satisfying the requirements of the Periodic Safety Review and very ably supported by our record of excellence in safety, operations and maintenance.""This is all down to the quality of our staff on site and with our plant and equipment in excellent condition; we can look forward to the future in confidence.""Staff at the site, which is run by Magnox North and owned by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA), have spent the last 12 months preparing the case to extend electricity generation at Wylfa.The process involved a safety review by the Health and Safety Executive, and the plant will undergo a further review by the regulator as generation continues.The site employs about 650 directly, while an estimated 500 jobs rely on Wylfa through contractors and suppliers.Dr Sara Johnston, from the NDA added: ""Wylfa's continued generation is excellent news as it will deliver significant extra revenue from one of the NDA's valuable assets. ""The income generated over the extension period will support our clean-up mission. I would like to thank Magnox North for the tremendous work they have done to help make this happen.""The decision has also been welcomed by Welsh Secretary, Cheryl Gillan: ""Wylfa plays a vital role in the local economy and today's announcement will be a great boost for its workforce. ""The decision to continue generating low carbon electricity at the site will also make a huge contribution to the NDA's decommissioning mission.""  Ynys Mon AM Ieuan Wyn Jones said the extension was ""crucial"" to the island's economy.""It is good news that the plant will be able to continue generating electricity for another two years, offering much needed peace of mind for the workers and their families,"" he said. Anglesey council welcomed the ""reducing of the gap"" between the start of decommissioning and the potential start of building of a replacement station.Council leader Clive McGregor added: ""Continued generation at Wylfa is good news for the Island's economy during increasingly uncertain times.""However, campaigners opposed to nuclear power have reiterated their objection to the extension.Dylan Morgan, of People Against Wylfa B (Pawb) said the plant should be closed, as planned in December this year.""They have already had two extensions - it is well past its design life,"" he said.""It can only increase the danger during operation, and it increase the waste produced.""A location near the existing Wylfa site has already been earmarked for a new nuclear plant, which could be operational by 2020.The developer hopes a planning application will be lodged by the end of 2011.Horizon Nuclear Power said a new station could deliver up to 800 high quality permanent jobs, rising to 1,000 during maintenance and up to 5,000 jobs during construction.

"Housing market still picking up, surveyors say","The UK's property market is benefiting from its normal spring pick up, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said.Its latest monthly survey of 245 members who work as estate agents suggests that prices are still going up.In April, 17% more surveyors said prices were rising rather than falling, up from 9% in March.Sales have picked up very slightly as well, Rics reported.   The average number of homes sold per surveyor rose to 17.4 over the three months to the end of April.A rise in the number of homes being put up for sale again outstripped the increase in enquiries from potential new buyers, which might suggest downward pressure on prices in the coming months.    But overall, Rics said its members had become much more optimistic about both sales and prices.""The start of spring has seen renewed optimism with the good weather improving sentiment and surveyors expecting an increase in both sales and house prices,"" said Rics spokesman Jeremy Leaf.""The housing market often sees an increase in new instructions in the early part of the year with sales boosted in the spring and this year has been no exception,"" he added. The feedback from Rics members contrasts with other recent reports on the state of the property market.Although prices have risen noticeably in the past year, the upward trend has been easing off in recent months, according to lenders such as the Halifax and Nationwide.Sales have been distinctly sluggish too across the UK.Although slightly higher than in the first three months of 2009, sales were still lower than in the first quarter of any year since statistics were first kept in their present form by HM Revenue &amp; Customs in 1977.According to Rics, whether prices are rising or falling depends very much on where you live.They have been rising fastest in London and the South East, but are falling in Yorkshire, Humberside, Wales and Northern Ireland.

UK retail sales 'fell in April',"UK retail sales fell in April owing to the timing of Easter and uncertainty from consumers ahead of the general election, figures indicate.The total value of sales fell by 0.2% in April from a year earlier, with the like-for-like drop at 2.3%, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) said.Food sales fell back, but this was distorted because of the early Easter compared with last year.The figures for this year only included Easter Sunday and Monday.The previous month's figures had been boosted by the inclusion of the first two days of the long Easter weekend, and had showed an increase of 4.4% in like-for-like sales.The three-month average, which diluted the Easter timing distortions, showed that like-for-like sales were up by 1.6% on a year earlier. The total value of sales was up 3.8%.""April's sales were down on a year ago, but that's because of the Easter effect. This April's trading period only included the last two days of Easter, while last year's had the entire build-up and holiday weekend,"" said Stephen Robertson, director general of the BRC.""Both food and non-food sales growth slipped back this April because people had already done their Easter spending in the previous month.""But he said that there had been ""caution"" among consumers ahead of the general election. Many had simply been shopping for essentials or to replace items, rather than embarking on discretionary spending.""There is no question customers are more willing to spend than 12 months ago but they are still nervous,"" Mr Robertson said. ""People need to know how a new government's moves to tackle the deficit will affect their incomes and jobs.

Fannie Mae asks for $8.4bn in aid,"US mortgage finance firm Fannie Mae has asked for another $8.4bn (£5.6bn) in state aid after announcing further big losses. The company said it lost $13.1bn in the first three months of the year as it continues to suffer the effects of the financial crisis. That is down from the $16.3bn loss it reported for the last quarter of 2009. But the continued fragility of the US economy and mortgage market meant it still needed government support. The US government took control of the two mortgage funding giants - Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - in 2008.The companies buy mortgages from approved lenders and sell them on - making them especially vulnerable to the collapse in the US mortgage market that sparked the crisis in the banking sector. So far the government has contributed $83.6bn to the bail-out of Fannie Mae. The cost of bailing out both institutions now totals nearly $145bn - but is expected to total much more. Fannie Mae said it saw ""no end in sight"" for government financial assistance. Earlier this month, Freddie Mac asked for a further $8bn, saying that the US housing market remained fragile.

Nature loss 'to damage economies',"The Earth's ongoing nature losses may soon begin to hit national economies, a major UN report has warned.The third Global Biodiversity Outlook (GBO-3) says that some ecosystems may soon reach ""tipping points"" where they rapidly become less useful to humanity.Such tipping points could include rapid dieback of forest, algal takeover of watercourses and mass coral reef death.Last month, scientists confirmed that governments would not meet their target of curbing biodiversity loss by 2010.""The news is not good,"" said Ahmed Djoglaf, executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).""We continue to lose biodiversity at a rate never before seen in history - extinction rates may be up to 1,000 times higher than the historical background rate.""The global abundance of vertebrates - the group that includes mammals, reptiles, birds, amphibians and fish - fell by about one-third between 1970 and 2006, the UN says.The 2010 target of significantly curbing the global rate of biodiversity loss was agreed at the Johannesburg summit in 2002. It has been clear for a while that it would not be met.But GBO-3 concludes that none of the 21 subsidiary targets set at the same time are being met either, at least not on a global basis.These include measures such as curbing the rate of habitat loss and degradation, protecting at least 10% of the Earth's ecological regions, controlling the spread of invasive species and making sure that international trade does not take any species towards extinction.No government submitting reports to the convention on biodiversity group claims to have completely met the 2010 target.While progress is being made in some regions, the global failure means an ever-growing number of species are on the Red List of Threatened Species.""Twenty-one percent of all known mammals, 30% of all known amphibians, 12% of all known birds (and)... 27% of reef-building corals assessed... are threatened with extinction,"" said Bill Jackson, deputy director general of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which maintains the Red List.""If the world made equivalent losses in share prices, there would be a rapid response and widespread panic.""The relationship between nature loss and economic harm is much more than just figurative, the UN believes.An ongoing project known as The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) is attempting to quantify the monetary value of various services that nature provides for us.These services include purifying water and air, protecting coasts from storms and maintaining wildlife for ecotourism.The rationale is that when such services disappear or are degraded, they have to be replaced out of society's coffers.TEEB has already calculated the annual loss of forests at $2-5 trillion, dwarfing costs of the banking crisis.""Many economies remain blind to the huge value of the diversity of animals, plants and other lifeforms and their role in healthy and functioning ecosystems,"" said Achim Steiner, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (Unep).""Humanity has fabricated the illusion that somehow we can get by without biodiversity, or that it is somehow peripheral to our contemporary world.""The truth is we need it more than ever on a planet of six billion heading to over nine billion people by 2050.""The more that ecosystems become degraded, the UN says, the greater the risk that they will be pushed ""over the edge"" into a new stable state of much less utility to humankind.For example, freshwater systems polluted with excess agricultural fertiliser will suffocate with algae, killing off fish and making water unfit for human consumption.The launch of GBO-3 comes as governments begin two weeks of talks in Nairobi aimed at formulating new measures to tackle global biodiversity loss that can be adopted at October's Convention on Biological Diversity summit in Japan.",Nature loss 'to damage economies',0

What's in the education minister's in-tray,"What's going to be waiting in the in-tray for whoever takes over running education in England?Regardless of any other political ambitions, there will already be some big items on the to-do list.Before anyone even gets the chance to swivel in the big chairs in the education department, the first challenge will be to get a grip on the primary school Sats tests, which might or might not be taken this week.If the ash cloud of the general election hadn't blotted out coverage, this would have been seen as an unprecedented challenge to the authority of any schools minister.The boycott by head teachers has cast a fog of confusion over these compulsory national tests.It remains unknown how many of the 600,000 pupils who should be taking Sats will be doing so - and how much the annual school league tables will be disrupted.It is also entirely unclear what happens when such figures of authority as head teachers decide not to do something that the government says is their statutory duty.There will be tricky choices for ministers on how to respond to this classroom rebellion.Should they act tough with head teachers? Or should they offer a flag of truce? Will ministers look weak if heads can pick and choose which policies they carry out?If they agree to change the testing regime, will it set a precedent for heads to ditch other ministerial projects?If they pick a fight with the heads, how much harder will it be to push through any other plans? While ministers propose, in the end it's thousands of head teachers who are central to making things happen.An even thornier issue will be waiting for higher education ministers: raising tuition fees.This had been kicked into the long grass with a review that was conveniently scheduled not to report until safely after the election. But the election result has mowed the grass and left this topic ticking away in full view, waiting for a minister brave enough to approach when the review reports back later this year.It's something of a perfect storm.More people than ever before want to go to university. It's become an expectation of middle England and the aspiration of many more. Disappointing these families is going to make them very unhappy voters.University places are very expensive and the government is desperate to limit public spending on higher education. They won't be able to pay for the thousands of extra places needed to meet the surging demand.But universities still need funding and many of them want to be able to charge higher fees - maybe £5,000, £7,000, £10,000 per year. In the US, leading universities charge three times as much.It's a poisoned chalice for any minister, particularly when they're keeping a weather eye on another election. Do they want to be identified with a plan to double or treble the cost of going to university?There are already cynics suggesting that in a climate of political uncertainty, the fees review might be spun out even longer.Both schools and higher education face another iceberg on the horizon. Funding. Or more particularly, the lack of it.Funding is going to be a recurrent problem for education ministers - likely to appear in many guises, affecting staffing, places, buildings, pay, outsourcing, vocational courses, equipment and innovation.These will compete for attention alongside hardy perennials such as worries about exam standards, behaviour and school admissions. The curriculum, as ever, will be promised to be ""slimmed down"" at the same time as a list of new things are promised to be added.Any incoming minister will want to make their mark with a raft of eye-catching policies - but this time they are going to be severely constrained on spending. The pressure will be to cut costs rather than to announce expansion.New ideas will have to be launched without much new money - and that's without factoring in extra spending that can't be avoided. For instance, there is going to be a continuing need for more primary school places in many parts of the country as the birth rate continues to climb.The years of splashing the cash look like they're over. It's going to be about clever savings and targeted spending. The challenge for ministers could be trying to find ways to sell less as more.",What's in the education minister's in-tray,0
British Airways fuel price-fixing trial collapses,"The trial of three ex-British Airways executives and one current employee on price-fixing charges has collapsed.Prosecuting QC Richard Latham told the judge at Southwark Crown Court in London he would offer ""no evidence"".The four men, who denied wrongdoing, had been accused of agreeing with Virgin Atlantic to fix fuel surcharge prices between 2004 and 2006.The judge had raised questions about the case brought by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT).Mr Justice Owen said he had considered ""whether the manifest failures on the part of the prosecution are such as to render a fair trial impossible"".BA's head of sales Andrew Crawley, ex-commercial director Martin George, ex-communications head Iain Burns and ex-UK and Irish Republic sales chief Alan Burnett were the four executives accused of price fixing.Mr George and Mr Burns resigned from BA in 2006, while Mr Burnett retired in the same year. Mr Crawley remains in his role.The court heard on Monday how the OFT had failed to disclose key information to the defence.The OFT said its decision to drop the case ""follows the discovery last week of a substantial volume of electronic material, which neither the OFT nor the defence had previously been able to review.""OFT accepts that to continue with the trial in light of this unforeseen development would be potentially unfair to the defendants.""One e-mail suggested that Virgin had increased its fuel surcharge without consulting BA, undermining claims that the two had colluded on fixing their surcharges.Lawyers for the four defendants said that had this e-mail come to light earlier, the case may never have come to court.After the collapse, Ben Emmerson QC, representing Mr Burns, attacked the OFT, calling it ""not fit for purpose"". He told the court that OFT chief executive John Fingleton and director of cartels Ali Nikpay ""must shoulder personal responsibility for this fiasco"".The OFT and prosecutors were ""guilty of incompetence on a monumental scale"" for pursuing a long and expensive case, Mr Emmerson said.The OFT rejected these accusations, saying that it had acted in the interests of justice at all times.Prosecutor Mr Latham added: ""The platform for gratuitous abuse which has just been used is wholly unacceptable.""He said the OFT will respond in court on Tuesday, when any applications for costs will also be heard.The OFT also said it would be reviewing the role of Virgin in the case, particularly in light of its obligations to provide the OFT with ""continuous and complete cooperation"".It added: ""This may have potential consequences for Virgin's immunity from penalties. However, no inferences or conclusions should be drawn at this stage regarding the outcome of that review.""The charges against the BA executives related to a period of 18 months, when fuel surcharges rose from £5 to £60 for a typical long-haul return ticket",British Airways fuel price-fixing trial collapses,0
Internet approaches addressing limit,"In less than 18 months there will be no more big blocks of net addresses to give out, estimates suggest.Predictions name 9 September 2011 as the date on which the last of those tranches is released for net firms and others to use.Everything connected to the net needs an ""IP address"" to ensure data reaches the right person or device. Experts say that the net's entire existing address space will be exhausted about a year after that date. A newer scheme is being rolled out but many firms and countries are being slow to switch, experts warn. The net is built around version four of the Internet Protocol addressing scheme (IPv4) which has space for about four billion addresses. Its successor - IPv6 - has trillions available.The continued growth of the net is tied to this pool of addresses.While four billion was enough in the 1970s when the net was being set up, the growth of the world wide web is rapidly depleting this store. The growth of the web has meant that only about 7% of these addresses, roughly 300 million, are left to allocate. This entire pool is expected to be depleted in April 2012.In early May, the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which oversees the net address space, handed over two of the big chunks of remaining addresses. The removal of these 17 million addresses from the global pool meant that the date on which there will be no more big chunks left jumped forward. ""This whole business of forecasting depletion involves a little bit of reading the tea leaves,"" said Axel Pawlik, managing director of Ripe NCC, which hands out IP addresses in Europe. ""Ten years ago we said it would happen far in the future,"" said Mr Pawlick. ""Now we are all running around with iPhones, we're in that future.""While the cut off date is 18 months away, some fear it will shrink as the pace at which addresses get used speeds up. Throughout the whole of 2009, IANA handed out eight of the big blocks of IPv4 addresses. In the first 100 days of 2010, it has handed out six.Trefor Davies, chief technology officer at business ISP Timico, said rationing of the remaining IPv4 addresses was already under way.""You cannot just ask for more IP addresses,"" he said. ""You have to prove you need them.""""The registries will not let you have more until your reserves reach a certain threshold,"" he said.While IPv4 and IPv6 can live alongside each other, anecdotal evidence suggests it is not a trouble-free union, said Mr Davies.The process of translating one address into the format of another introduces a significant delay. Unless more ISPs and others start to adopt IPv6 those delays could start to hit general web browsing, fears Mr Davies.""It adds quite a lot of latency onto people accessing your network because it has to go through network address translation,"" he said.Mr Pawlick from Ripe said it had seen significant growth in requests for IPv6 addresses over the last few months.

Wife killer conviction overturned,"A man serving life for strangling his doctor wife should stand trial again, appeal judges have ordered.Nabeel Khan, 45, was found guilty in August 2009 of murdering pathologist Iffat Kamal and was told he would spend at least 15 years in prison.But appeal judges have now ruled Khan suffered a miscarriage of justice.They said the trial judge, Lord Hardie, had misdirected the jury over the differences between murder and culpable homicide.Giving their decision, Lord Justice Clerk Lord Gill said how the jury reached their decision was ""a matter of speculation"".But he said the way Lord Hardie had asked jurors to consider their verdict could have affected the outcome of the trial.After the ruling that Khan had suffered a miscarriage of justice, advocate depute Alex Prentice QC asked Lord Gill, sitting with Lords Eassie and Bonomy, to order a fresh trial and they agreed.No date has yet been fixed for Khan to return to court.Consultant pathologist Dr Kamal, 39, died in Dundee's Ninewells Hospital where she worked, 10 days after an attack in her home in the city's Simpson Court on 10 December 2008.Jailing Nabeel Khan for life, Lord Hardie described the murdered woman as ""a successful, dedicated pathologist"".The trial last year heard that Khan had a gambling habit and told a psychiatrist he had lost £17,000 playing online poker and other forms of betting and also used his wife's credit card while she was in India. Pakistan-born Khan, who is a German citizen, was said to have slapped Dr Kamal and then fatally throttled her by putting his arm around her neck. ",Wife killer conviction overturned,0

UK industrial output rises 2% in March,"UK industrial output saw its strongest monthly expansion in almost eight years in March, official figures have shown.Output rose by 2.0% compared with February, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. Analysts had expected a 0.3% rise.Strong export demand contributed to a powerful performance by manufacturers.The ONS estimated that the data would add 0.1 percentage points to the UK's first-quarter GDP growth - initially estimated at 0.2%.Manufacturing output rose by 2.3% on a month-on-month basis.The transport and metal sectors of manufacturing had done particularly well, the ONS said.There have been hopes that a weak pound would boost the UK economy by making its exports cheaper.The EEF manufacturing group said the UK was seeing ""a broad-based recovery for a sector hard hit by the recession"".But its chief economist, Lee Hopley, said that a ""credible plan to repair the public finances"" was needed to ""both reassure financial markets and underpin a sustainable recovery"".",UK industrial output rises 2% in March,0
E.On profits slip despite UK growth,"E.On, Germany's biggest power producer, has reported a 7% fall in first-quarter profits after restructuring costs hit otherwise good underlying growth.The company reported profits of 2.3bn euros (£1.97bn), down from 2.5bn euros for the same period a year earlier.However, underlying earnings for the quarter were 3.7bn euros, up from 3.1bn euros. E.On said it had seen particularly good earnings growth at its UK and recently-established renewable energy divisions.The company said that the fall in headline profits was due to the tax implications on disposals and other restructuring charges, particularly the disposal of E.On's US energy unit PPL.Overall sales in the quarter were 26.2bn euros, up 1.1% from a year earlier.For the rest of of 2010, E.On said it was ""cautiously optimistic"" and maintained a forecast for core earnings to be stable or rise up to 3%.Meanwhile, France's biggest power utility, Electricite de France, said sales had risen 4.3% in the first quarter, boosted by acquisitions in the US and Belgium.The state-controlled company said sales were 21.9bn euros, up from 21bn euros in the first quarter of 2009.

Train operators accused of 'astronomical' fare rises,"Some of the UK's biggest train operators are being accused of ""astronomical"" fare rises, as a result of extending peak-time hours.The rail watchdog Passenger Focus says that some fares have nearly quadrupled since last year.Train companies say that the number of people affected by such rises is ""tiny"".Since January, over 180 trains a week have been rescheduled as ""peak-time"", a BBC survey found.By redesignating trains as ""peak"", this allows train companies to increase fares without needing permission from the regulator.Edward Welsh, of the Association of Train Operating Companies (Atoc), says the vast majority of travellers have seen fares fall, stay the same or rise below the rate of inflation.""The average increase in fares this January was 1.1%. That's the lowest since privatisation 15 years ago,"" he says.One train affected by the rises is the 0950 Virgin Trains service from Birmingham to London.Last year this train was off peak. But after Virgin decided to extend ticket restrictions for more than an hour a day, it is now peak.On board, we found businessman Antony Ray, who has no choice but to use this particular service.As a result of the changes, his fare from Telford to London has more than tripled from £45 to £158 for a return journey.""It's crazy,"" he says. ""You basically can't get down to London and get back in time for meetings. The car's much cheaper.""Last year, taking the 0915 from London Euston to Manchester, returning at 0855 the next day, would have cost £66. Now that Virgin has extended its peak hours, the same ticket costs £262.Anthony Smith, of Passenger Focus, says such rises are astronomical.""Tinkering with ticket restrictions causes confusion. And if your journey has gone up by four times, you're going to feel you've been done,"" he says.Our survey found that South West Trains, which runs commuter routes out of London Waterloo, has redesignated 114 trains, including all services between 1600 and 1900.However, the company points out that even though super off-peak tickets are no longer valid on these services, off-peak tickets are still accepted.Virgin has redesignated 75 trains a week as peak, as a result of extending peak hours by 35 minutes in the morning, and 28 minutes in the afternoon. To get an off-peak service into London, passengers need to arrive in the capital after 1130.The first Virgin off-peak service from Rugby is listed for 1124, meaning you would not arrive in London until after midday.However, on the East Coast mainline, which was taken over by the government last year, five trains a week have been reassigned the other way, from peak to off-peak.Both Virgin and South West Trains point out that the number of people affected by such rises is relatively small. Virgin told the BBC that 3.4% of their services have been redesignated. The figure for South West Trains is 8%. Virgin also pointed out that passengers can make considerable savings by buying their tickets in advance, and online.An Atoc spokesman said: ""Picking out fares that will only be paid by a very small proportion of customers, gives an incredibly partial impression of ticket prices. ""This year, thanks to the lowest fare rises since privatisation, the vast majority of people have seen fares fall, stay the same or rise below the rate of inflation.""Atoc also adds the train fares affected by peak-time hours being extended is a very small minority - under one per cent - of millions of journeys made daily on the railway network. The changes in peak services are complex for passengers to understand.  It is all too easy to get on a train with the wrong ticket, or to pay more than necessary.So can they expect to get clear advice from railway staff? Not according to the consumer magazine, Which?In a survey last year, Which? found that one in three station staff gave out incorrect advice, and nearly half of National Rail Enquiries staff passed on the wrong information.""That leads to customer confusion,"" says Matt Bath from the magazine. ""Customers can hold the wrong tickets and potentially travel at the wrong time.""But Atoc disputes the findings of the Which? survey. It claims that independent research has found that 99% of the advice being given out is accurate.Passenger Focus says the truth lies somewhere in the middle.Train operators are doing nothing wrong by redesignating trains as peak-time services.And it does have one major advantage for them.At the moment only off-peak fares are controlled by the regulator. So lengthening peak hours gives operators much more freedom to increase prices at will.But given some rather more urgent priorities for the new UK government, there is unlikely to be immediate pressure to change the current rules - even though extending peak times means the operators will find it hard to duck the accusation that it is a very easy way to put up fares.",Train operators accused of 'astronomical' fare rises,0
Wikimedia pornography row deepens as Wales cedes rights,"A row over sexually explicit content on the web encyclopaedia Wikipedia and related sites has escalated.Co-founder Jimmy Wales has given up some of his site privileges following protests by contributors angered that he deleted images without consultation.Mr Wales had previously urged the removal of ""pornographic"" content from the user-generated site.This followed a complaint about ""child pornography"" to the FBI from another Wikipedia co-founder.In early April, the estranged co-founder, Larry Sanger, reported Wikimedia Commons to the FBI, alleging that the organisation was ""knowingly distributing child pornography"".He later clarified that his concern was not about photographs of children, but ""obscene visual representations of the abuse of children"", which can include drawings and sculpture.Last week, administrators of Wikimedia Commons, a media file store widely used for Wikipedia articles, deleted hundreds of images.  Some images deemed by the Wikipedia community to have educational merit have since been reinstated.Mr Wales had earlier posted his support for the removal of ""images that are of little or no educational value but which appeal solely to prurient interests"", deleting many pictures himself.Pressure on the organisation had increased after Fox News reported the story, contacting a number of high-profile corporate donors to the Wikimedia Foundation, which owns Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons and related sites.It asked whether the donors were aware of ""the extent of sexually explicit content"" on Wikimedia Commons.It is not clear whether Mr Wales's support for the removal of explicit content was in response to Mr Sanger's concerns, pressure from Fox News, or something else.But Michael Peel, Chair of Wikimedia UK, told BBC News that a continuous debate over explicit content has recently ""come to a head"".  The central issue at the moment, he says, is ""whether the content is educational"".  ""Anyone can come to Wikimedia Commons and upload media.  Illegal stuff is deleted, and copyright stuff is deleted.""Mr Wales has faced criticism from the band of volunteers who help to maintain the site, some of whom argued that the decision to delete was undemocratic and taken too quickly.  They also expressed concerns that valid material might be deleted accidentally.On Sunday, in response, Jimmy Wales voluntarily revoked many of the ""permissions"" given to him as Wikipedia's founder, to delete and edit ""protected"" content on Wikimedia Commons.  In a message to the Wikimedia Foundation mailing list he said this was ""in the interest of encouraging this discussion to be about real philosophical/content issues, rather than be about me and how quickly I acted"".A more detailed policy statement from the Wikimedia Foundation is expected in the coming days.",Wikimedia pornography row deepens as Wales cedes rights,0
Animals need 'right to privacy' from wildlife films,"Animals' right to privacy needs to be taken more seriously by wildlife documentary makers, suggests research.The ethics of the media and privacy should be extended beyond humans to the animal world, suggests Brett Mills at the University of East Anglia.He says it might be acceptable to film ""public events"" such as animals hunting - but questions more intrusive recording.Dr Mills says animals should not be seen as ""fair game"" for filmmakers.An academic in the university's film and television department, Dr Mills says ""we see it as unethical and wrong to secretly film people - we say it's not allowed"".But when it comes to animals being recorded in documentaries, such questions are never raised, he says.""What does it say about our assumptions about animals?"" asks Dr Mills.The research, Television Wildlife: Documentaries and Animals' Right to Privacy, wants to start a debate about whether animals should receive more respect from filmmakers.Should cameras be shoved down burrows? Should animals be stalked by hidden cameras?""It might at first seem odd to claim that animals might have a right to privacy,"" said Dr Mills.But he says that animal behaviour shows that they can make a distinction between public and private behaviour.There are times when they withdraw from ""public"" areas, he says, and appear to want privacy.For humans, he says, it is assumed that documentary makers would need consent to go into people's private lives, but no such boundary exists for wildlife filmmakers.""When confronted with such 'secretive' behaviour the response of the wildlife documentary is to read it as a challenge to be overcome with the technologies of television. ""The question constantly posed by wildlife documentaries is how animals should be filmed: they never ask whether animals should be filmed at all.""The research, published in Continuum: Journal of Media and Cultural Studies, wants to raise a debate over whether there should be ethical considerations about the filming of animals.Teaching students about making television documentaries often involves ethical discussions about what is permissible to be recorded, he says - and also examining how people might give up their privacy to become part of a documentary.But while wildlife documentaries are seen as a ""good thing"", he wants to ask why there is such little discussion of the rights of their unknowing star performers.",Animals need 'right to privacy' from wildlife films,0
Banks deluged by backlog of complaints,"The UK's banks had to deal with a huge backlog of complaints in the second half of last year, figures from the Financial Services Authority show.Banks and building societies dealt with 2,014,000 complaints, up from 867,427 in the first half of the year.This was because they were finally allowed to process more than a million complaints about overdraft charges.These had been on hold since the middle of 2007, pending the outcome of a high-profile legal test case.This was finally resolved last November in favour of the banks, when the Supreme Court ruled against an attempt by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to challenge the fairness of bank overdraft charges using existing consumer protection laws.""The complaints were put on hold with an FSA waiver for the duration of the test case between the OFT and major banks, which ended last December,"" the FSA explained.""Banks now have to deal with these complaints, which account for most of the increase in complaints specifically related to banking during this period."" Overall, the financial services industry received nearly 2.7 million complaints in the last six months of 2009, up from 1,510,886 in the first half of the year.This was the largest number since the initial surge of bank overdraft complaints hit the industry in the first half of 2007, when in total just over two million complaints were received.After banking services, the next largest category of business that upset customers was general insurance and pure protection, which generated 421,368 complaints, up from 337,000 in the previous six months.It was these policies that led to most compensation being paid to customers.Banks, building societies and other sellers of insurance repaid £144m to customers in the last half of 2009 as a direct result of their complaints, out of a total of £284m redress paid to buyers of all types of financial product.Of the insurance complaints, 174,000 related to the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.",Banks deluged by backlog of complaints,0
Carlsberg profits hit by Russian beer tax hike,"Profits at the Danish brewer Carlsberg have been hit by a Russian beer tax, falling by 7% in the first 3 months of 2010.Operating profit fell to 735m kroner ($125.2m; £84.4m) from 788m kroner last year.However, the figure was better than analysts had predicted and Carlsberg's shares rose on the news.Sales in Carlsberg's key region of Russia fell by 12% after the government tripled the tax on beer.The fall was partly offset by improving sales in Western Europe and Asia where volumes grew 3% and 16% respectively.Carlsberg says that it is still aiming for 20% net profit growth in 2010 and it anticipates ""outperforming the market"".",Carlsberg profits hit by Russian beer tax hike,0
Google answers privacy questions posed by commissioners,"Google has defended its privacy practices following a letter of complaint from data protection commissioners around the world.The original letter expressed concerns on privacy issues surrounding Google's social networking tool Buzz and its Street View service.In response Google said it was ""committed to ensuring privacy is designed into our products"".But it admitted that mistakes were made with the launch of Buzz.""We do not get everything 100% right - that is why we acted so quickly on Google Buzz,"" said the letter, signed by Jane Horvath and Peter Fleischer, global privacy counsel for Google.A spokesman for Google said the letter represented Google's ""full response"" to the concerns raised by ten privacy commissioners from around the world, including the UK, Canada and France. Google insisted that it had a ""core commitment"" to privacy.""We are keenly aware of the trust that our users place in our services, and of our responsibility to protect their privacy. As part of this responsibility, we are committed to being transparent with our users about the information that we collect,"" the letter read.""Respecting privacy is a part of every Googler's job,"" it added.This respect was not apparent to all users at the launch of its social networking service Buzz. The search giant found itself with a flurry of complaints from users unhappy that their Gmail accounts had automatically been connected to the service without their consent.As the row escalated, Google moved quickly to enable Buzz users to set their own privacy controls.In a subsequent letter from Canada's privacy commissioner Jennifer Stoddart, this prompt response was praised.But the letter also raised concerns about the way Google handled users' privacy.It was co-signed by Ms Stoddart's counterparts in France, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and the UK.It called on Google to collect and process the minimum amount of personal information required for a service, to be clear about how it would be used and to ensure that privacy settings were default and easy to use.It also expressed unease about Street View, Google's street level, 360-degree photographs of areas taken by specially equipped Google vehicles.In Germany there has been criticism of the Street View service because it has recorded the details of private wi-fi networks. Germany's Federal Commissioner for Data Protection Peter Schaar has complained to Google.A legal claim in February 2009 by a Pittsburgh couple who said that Street View violated their privacy was thrown out by a federal judge.",Google answers privacy questions posed by commissioners,0
Twitter hit by major disruption,"Twitter has fixed a major bug that saw many users of the service appear to lose all of their followers and friends.The problem began when a flaw was uncovered that allowed people to force others to ""follow"" them on the site. People who typed ""accept"" followed by a person's Twitter name forced the user to be added to their list of followers. The hack was quickly passed around the social network with many people using it to force celebrities to follow them. It could have easily allowed spammers to insert messages into thousands of accounts. Twitter quickly closed the loophole but was forced to temporarily reset many accounts as it cleaned up the damage. The reset made it look like many users had no followers and were also following no one.""We identified and resolved a bug that permitted a user to 'force""' other users to follow them,"" the site said in a blog post. People were still able to use the service during the disruption.Twitter allows users to post messages - known as tweets - up to 140 characters long.People can see what others are writing by choosing to ""follow"" them. However, unlike many social networks, both parties do not have to reciprocate the friendship.The new bug allowed many people to force celebrities, such as Lady Gaga, to follow them by simply typing ""accept @ladygaga"". This would make it appear that Lady Gaga had chosen to follow them and would also inject a user's tweets into the singer's feeds. The flaw only worked on the website and not through third-party software used to access the service, such as Tweetdeck. A Turkish man known as bilo31 originally posted details of the so-called ""follow bug"".  He explained on a Turkish website that he has little knowledge of computer programming, and had stumbled on the flaw by accident.He said that he is a fan of a heavy metal band called Accept.  When he tweeted ""Accept pwnz"", he discovered that he was automatically being followed by the user @pwnz.Twitter has exploded in popularity since 2007, when it was launched, and now has more than 100 million users.  News of the flaw follows the discovery of a recent high-profile security bug at Facebook, another poster child of the social web.The exploit - now fixed - exploited the site's privacy settings and allowed users to eavesdrop on their friends' live chats and see their pending friend requests.

T-Mobile and Orange brands to remain in UK,"Both the Orange and T-Mobile brands will be retained in the UK, their parent company has said.

Q&A: Can Europe's 750bn euro bailout package work,"European governments and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have stunned global stock markets with a 750bn-euro ($975bn; £650bn) package of standby funds designed to see off financial meltdown. How will it work?The 27 countries of the European Union (EU) will contribute 500bn euros towards the financial safety net. They have been joined by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which is providing another 250bn euros.The vast bulk of Europe's contribution comes from the 16-nation eurozone bloc, which is promising 440bn in loan guarantees. The European Commission is providing 60bn euros immediately.Crucially, the European Central Bank is to start buying bonds - government debt - something the European Central Bank said it would never do when it was established.To stop the financial crisis in Greece from spreading and to calm financial markets, which dived last week because of concerns about the eurozone. Governments hope that by promising to protect the eurozone they will promote confidence and encourage banks and other financial institution to lend to Spain and Portugal, where investors are demanding very high interest rates to loan money.The magnitude and co-ordination of the package is also designed to signal to financial speculators that governments will do what it takes to protect the eurozone and its currency.Many speculators who bet against the euro and the bond markets last week will have lost money as a result of the deal, which has pushed markets higher.The UK is not part of the eurozone, so its contribution to the package is via the European Commission fund and the IMF. It is thought that if countries being loaned money defaulted the total UK liability could be about £15bn, though about £7bn of this money was pledged to a previous bail-out fund.Alistair Darling, chancellor of the exchequer, said that the UK's exposure was ""minimal"" and that the UK was not underwriting the euro. In an interview with the BBC he suggested that the UK was providing an additional £8bn in new money through its IMF and European Commission contribution. There is a lot of fine detail still to be worked out. The 60bn euros in emergency lending is available immediately and can be drawn on now by countries such as Spain and Portugal.But a special purpose vehicle to dish out 440bn euros in bilateral loan guarantees will take longer to set up.The ECB will intervene as and when it thinks necessary, buying bonds to help bolster confidence and kick-start markets.However, the ECB will not be pumping fresh money into ailing economies. The ECB's purchase of bonds will be matched by the selling of other securities. So, the package will not be used to fund the public spending cuts and tax rises needed in bloated economies such as Spain and Portugal.No, it does not. But the financial measures are designed to restore stability so that the longer term structural issues can be resolved.The package has been likened to pouring water into a bucket with a hole. Eventually, you'll will have to fix the leak. The weaker European countries will still have to re-pay their debts. And in the longer term that will only come from stronger economic growth and raising more tax revenues.That said, the initial response from stock markets seems to suggest that ailing economies will get the financial breathing space needed to repair their buckets.Share prices across Asia and Europe surged on news of the package, and the euro strengthened.Just a few weeks ago, the eurozone looked as if it was unravelling at the seams, with Greece destined to exit the single currency and the European Union in tatters.Now eurozone leaders are hailing the package as a further step towards closer co-operation and integration. If countries are lending their neighbours vast amounts of money, they become further entwined.In addition, the ECB is taking on a more powerful role in Europe, perhaps becoming something more akin to America's Federal Reserve.",Q&A: Can Europe's 750bn euro bailout package work,0

China's inflation accelerates as house prices soar,"China's inflation accelerated in April after house and food prices jumped and bank lending increased.The news will fuel concerns that the world's third-largest economy is overheating and that Beijing may need to raise interest rates.April's consumer prices were up 2.8% from a year ago, the highest rate in 18 months, and property inflation hit 12.8%, China's statistics bureau said.New bank lending of 774bn yuan ($8.4bn; £5.65bn) exceeded predictions.Many analysts had forecast an inflation rate of 2.7%.Foreign investors are watching closely to see whether Beijing moves to cool prices, as this would slow China's economic growth.Standard Chartered economist Jinny Yan said he did not think there was an immediate danger of an interest rate rise because of the European debt crisis and fragile international economy.""What [Beijing] will do is observe external markets for a while longer before deciding what to do,"" she said.But Brian Jackson, strategist at Bank of Canada, was not so sure.

Orlando Bloom burglary: Reality star admits charge,"An 18-year-old reality TV star has been sentenced to six months in jail after she admitted taking part in a burglary at actor Orlando Bloom's LA home.Alexis Neiers earlier told police she was at the house during a July 2009 burglary in which paintings and watches were stolen but denied taking anything.Five other people accused of a series of break-ins at the homes of Hollywood stars are awaiting trial.Neiers and her two sisters appear in E! show Pretty Wild.It follows the lives of ""three sisters whose jaw-dropping looks and unstructured upbringing make them magnets for Tinseltown's temptations"".Neiers also told police she was being sick outside Bloom's house after ""drinking a lot"".She was also sentenced at Los Angeles Superior Court to three years of probation with the threat of a further two-year prison sentence if she violates the terms.In the US, criminals are punished in prisons for more serious crimes and in jails for lesser offences.Neiers, who was facing up to six years in prison if convicted at trial, will begin her sentence on 24 June.""After lengthy considerations and fighting the best pre-trial fight we could, we decided it was in Alexis's best interests to take responsibility for her small part in this incident,"" her defence lawyer Jeffery K Rubenstein said.British actor Bloom, who has starred in the hit Pirates of the Caribbean films, had been expected to testify against her if the case had gone to full trial.Burglaries on the homes of a number of celebrities, including Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan and Megan Fox, were carried out between December 2008 and September 2009.None was at home at the times of the break-ins, which led to the theft of $3m (£2m) worth of property.According to police documents released in November, 19-year-old Nicholas Prugo confessed to the break-ins and implicated several other suspects.He and four others face a 25 May hearing to find out if there is enough evidence for a trial.",Orlando Bloom burglary: Reality star admits charge,0
Software piracy continues global rise,"Software piracy around the world has risen again, according to a report from the Business Software Alliance (BSA).The industry body says that losses from software piracy amounted to $51.4bn (£34.8bn) in 2009.It singled out computer users in the Asia Pacific region as the source of the biggest dollar losses in the world.But, it says, there are also positive signs, as the rate of piracy declined in more than 50 countries, and rose in only 19.In the UK, 27% of software in use was found to be pirated, a figure that has remained steady for the last few years.Businesses and individuals in the ex-Soviet state of Georgia are the world's top pirated software users, the body said, with 95% of software installed there believed to be bootlegged.At the other end of the scale, the report found that just 20% of software in use in the US is illegal.According to Victor Lim, a vice president at IDC, which carried out the research with the BSA, close to 60% of the 900 million pieces of software in use in the Asia Pacific region are unlicensed.BSA's vice-president, Jeffrey Hardee said that a 10 percentage point reduction in software piracy in the Asia Pacific region would ""directly contribute"" 41 billion dollars to the region's economies.  He argued that it would help create 435,000 jobs.But he also explained that companies, not individuals, inflict the most significant financial damage by their use of pirated software.  ""Surprisingly, quite a few listed companies are caught using pirated software. They just have unsophisticated or no software management policies in place,"" he told AFP. ""It's quite shocking.""He added that ""companies also risk compromising the security of their databases by using pirated software"".Singapore was the only Southeast Asian country to feature in the list of 30 countries with the lowest rates of software piracy use.",Software piracy continues global rise,0
Easyjet says ash disruption cost up to £75m,"Low-cost airline Easyjet has said the disruption caused by the recent volcanic eruption in Iceland will cost it between £50m and £75m.The cost means the airline has lowered its profit forecast for the full-year to between £100m and £150m.The carrier reported a £78.7m loss for the six months to the end of March, against a £129.8m loss a year ago.Meanwhile, TUI Travel said the ash disruption had cost it £90m, as it reported a six-month loss of £367m.The deficit was worse than the £333m loss it recorded a year earlier, but Europe's biggest travel operator said the performance was in line with expectations.As well as reporting smaller losses, Easyjet said revenue for the six-month period increased to £1.2bn from £1bn a year earlier.Despite the disruption, Easyjet said it was on course to deliver ""remarkable performance"" this year.""Easyjet will deliver substantial profit growth in 2010 through the worst recession in 70 years,"" said chief executive Andy Harrison.The company also said it had increased its market share of short-haul flights over the past 12 months to 7.6%, up from 6.5% in the previous 12 months.Easyjet said the disruption caused by the Eyjafjallajokull volcano last month forced it to cancel 6,512 flights, disrupting 850,000 passengers. It said it was in the process of seeking compensation from governments for the additional cost and lost revenues incurred due to the five-day closure of European airspace.The airline also said it had been hit to the tune of £21m by the ""exceptional snowfall"" in December 2009 and January 2010.",Easyjet says ash disruption cost up to £75m,0
Academics urge radical new approach to climate change,"A major change of approach is needed if society is to restrain climate change, according to a report from a self-styled ""eclectic"" group of academics.The UN process has failed, they argue, and a global approach concentrating on CO2 cuts will never work.They urge instead the use of carbon tax revenue to develop technologies that can supply clean energy to everyone.Their so-called Hartwell Paper is criticised by others who say the UN process has curbed carbon emissions.The paper is named after Hartwell House, the Buckinghamshire mansion, hotel and spa where the group of 14 academics from Europe, North America and Japan gathered in February to develop their ideas.Its central message is that climate change can be ameliorated best by pursuing ""politically attractive and relentlessly pragmatic"" options that also curb emissions.These options include bringing a reliable electricity supply to the estimated 1.5 billion people in the world without it using efficient, low-carbon technologies.""The raising up of human dignity is the central driver of the Hartwell Paper, replacing the preoccupation with human sinfulness that has failed and will continue to fail to deliver progress,"" said lead author Prof Gwyn Prins.Prof Prins is director of the Mackinder Programme for the Study of Long Wave Events at the London School of Economics and Political Science, and an adviser to the Global Warming Policy Foundation, the UK charity chaired by Lord Lawson that aims ""to help restore balance and trust in the climate debate"".The paper says that the outcome of December's UN climate summit, plus the ""ClimateGate"" affair and inaccuracies within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 report, means ""the legitimacy of the institutions of climate policy and science are no longer assured"".So, successfully tackling climate change initially means re-framing the issue.In an article for the BBC's Green Room series, another of the authors, Mike Hulme, writes: ""Climate change has been represented as a conventional environmental 'problem' that is capable of being 'solved'.  ""It is neither of these. Yet this framing has locked the world into the rigid agenda that brought us to the dead end of Kyoto, with no evidence of any discernable acceleration of decarbonisation whatsoever.""The academics advocate concentrating first on short-term fixes for greenhouse gases or other warming agents, such as black carbon - particles emitted from the incomplete burning of fossil fuels, principally in diesel engines and wood stoves.These particles warm the planet by several mechanisms, including darkening snow so it absorbs more solar energy.Black carbon may be the second most important man-made warming agent after carbon dioxide.As it remains in the atmosphere for a matter of weeks, some researchers have suggested that cleaning up its production could be the quickest way of curbing warming, as well as bringing health benefits to poor countries by reducing air pollution.""To date, climate policy has focused on carbon dioxide primarily, and even to the exclusion of other human influences on the climate system,"" the report says.""We believe this path to have been unwise... early action on a wider range of human influences on climate could be more swiftly productive.""However, they acknowledge that carbon emissions do in the end have to be constrained. To that end, they recommend implementing a hypothecated carbon tax in developed economies to fund development of low-carbon energy technologies.The damaging effects of climate change in developing countries, meanwhile, would be tackled by having Western countries meet the internationally agreed target of contributing 0.7% of their GDP to overseas aid, rather than through specific and complex new climate adaptation funds.""Just this one action alone would swamp the miserly amounts of money being offered under the Copenhagen Accord,"" said Prof Hulme.The outcome of the Copenhagen climate summit - widely seen as a failure among academics and activists - has caused considerable soul-searching about alternative approaches.But any move away from the negotiated process that puts CO2 at centre stage is regarded as anathema by many.""The paper's focus away from CO2 is misguided, short-sighted and probably wrong,"" said Bill Hare from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany.""If you take action on black carbon and do not reduce CO2 emissions then you may end up with more warming in the long term,"" he told BBC News.""And in fact, the Kyoto Protocol is one of the few things that have worked, in that it's given momentum to low-carbon energy development - we wouldn't have had the explosion in wind power without it.""The Hartwell Paper initiative was supported by funding from the Japan Iron and Steel Federation, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association, the US-based Nathan Cummings Foundation and the Fondation Hoffmann, Geneva.",Academics urge radical new approach to climate change,0

US share price crash inquiry finds no single cause,"An investigation into last week's mysterious plunge in US share prices has found no single cause was to blame.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it still needed more time to investigate, but warned that new safeguards would be introduced.SEC chairman Mary Schapiro told a Congressional hearing that the markets had ""failed"" many investors.On 6 May, the Dow Jones fell a lightning-fast 700 points, sending shivers through the investor community.Theories about the possible cause ranged from a rogue trader to terrorism. All have been discounted, the SEC said.Mrs Schapiro told the hearing that it would take time to pinpoint the cause and warned that investor confidence could suffer if there were no reforms.""The markets failed many investors on May 6, and I am committed to finding effective solutions in the very near term,"" she said.Although she suggested that the cause was possibly due to a confluence of events, no regulator or exchange has provided a full account of events or concluded what caused the drop.""The sudden evaporation of meaningful prices for many major exchange-listed stocks in the middle of a trading day is unacceptable and clearly contrary to the vital policy objective of maintaining fair and orderly financial markets,"" Mrs Schapiro said.It seems likely that the SEC will now focus its investigation on computer-driven high-frequency trading (HFT), in which share dealing is carried out a rapid speed.More than 100 SEC staff are probing last week's events, and sifting through more than 17 million share trades.Reports has suggested the SEC was looking specifically into trades in Procter &amp; Gamble, but Mrs Shapiro said nothing unusual was found.On Monday, the heads of major exchanges and the SEC agreed to strengthen existing circuit breakers that are designed to stop HFT exacerbating share price falls.It is possible that the additional safeguards will include circuit breakers that would trigger a pause in trading if a share price fell more than 10% in a five minute period.",US share price crash inquiry finds no single cause,0

European debt fears stall US stock markets,"US shares closed lower as global stock markets stalled on niggling worries over European debt problems.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones index closed down 0.34% following a turbulent day's trading, and a nearly 4% rise on Monday. A White House spokesman admitted US President Barack Obama was concerned over the situation in Europe.European measures to halt the debt crisis were announced at the weekend. The package of loans and guarantees worth 750bn euros ($975bn; £650bn) initially buoyed markets, with shares in London up 5% and the Paris stock market up 9%. But both markets fell today, by 1% and 0.7% respectively. Shares in Frankfurt were up slightly. President Obama was said to be ""actively engaged"" in preventing the impact of the crisis from spreading to the US financial sector.The concern is that a loss of confidence in some European economies with high debt levels could spread to other economies, including the US.President Obama earlier spoke to the Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero to stress the importance of the country taking ""resolute action"" to strengthen its economy and build market confidence. Spain has been deemed at risk by global investors, alongside Greece and Portugal. In the UK, share prices fell in line with European markets. Uncertainty during the day over who will form the next government did not appear to hit investor confidence.Although the FTSE fell slightly, the successful auction of UK government bonds on Tuesday morning suggested a vote of confidence in the UK economy among global investors. Demand for the bonds remained strong, with the issue being two-and-half times oversubscribed.The government wanted to borrow £2.25bn, while investors offered to lend £5.6bn.As a coalition government between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats looked more likely, the pound rose against the dollar and the euro. The pound rose above $1.50 following the resignation of Gordon Brown, having reached a low of around $1.4725 earlier in the day. Against the euro, the pound also rose to 1.1793 euros. Todd Elmer, a currency strategist at Citigroup, said the pound could rise further providing the UK's public finances are tackled. ""Sterling has been sensitive with all the back and forth,"" he said. ""Now, with more clarity in regards to the future government, there's scope for positive surprises. ""If the government implements fiscal adjustments quickly, for example, that would be very supportive to sterling.""More widely, investors remain concerned over how successful the package of measures agreed by EU members on Sunday will be in tackling Europe's debt problems. Many have pointed out that the loans and guarantees promised too little to tackle the underlying problem of high levels of borrowing and debt. ",European debt fears stall US stock markets,0

German economic growth beat forecasts in first quarter,"The German economy, Europe's largest, expanded 0.2% in the first quarter of 2010, beating forecasts of zero growth.Many analysts predicted German gross domestic product would stagnate in the quarter.The country's statistics office, Destatis, also revised growth upwards in the fourth quarter of 2009 to 0.2% from its first estimate of no growth.This meant that GDP contraction for 2009 had been reduced to 4.9%, Destatis said.""The German economy is slowly gaining momentum,"" Destatis said in a statement.The better-than-expected first quarter figure came despite Germany's harsh winter, which hampered construction activity.Destatis said that exports and investments in industrial equipment were the main drivers of growth.The German government has forecast growth of 1.4% this year.Germany went into recession in 2008 as demand for its exports dried up amid the global recession.After shrinking for four straight quarters, including a 3.5% fall in the first quarter of 2009, Germany emerged from recession in the second quarter of last year.Germany lost its position as the world's biggest exporter to China last year, but exports have been recovering recently.Earlier this month, the government said exports in April jumped by 10.7% compared with March and were up by nearly a quarter from a year ago.",German economic growth beat forecasts in first quarter,0
Microsoft's two-pronged strategy for Office 2010,"There is only one thing more important to Microsoft than the success of its new Windows 7 operating system, and that's the success of Office 2010, the latest version of its suite of productivity software.For Microsoft, Office is the real cash cow. Except in years when Microsoft launches a new operating system, it is Office that generates most of the firm's profits through corporate licensing deals.But a lot has changed since the last launch of the US software giant's office software package - with Word for text processing, Outlook for e-mail, Powerpoint for presentations, and corporate mainstay Excel for spreadsheets (plus a range of other applications).For starters, people are using computers differently. Companies now have to provide for a highly mobile and dispersed workforce; consumers, meanwhile, live their digital lives less through e-mail and more through social networks.Companies also still worry about the economy; spending on information technology is recovering, but slowly. Microsoft now has competition, most notably from old rival Google with its range of free (for consumers) or cheap (for companies) online applications.These days ""it is very hard to sell an office suite to consumers"", says Sheri McLeish, an analyst with technology consulting firm Forrester. Most have some version of Office on their computer, she says, and for everybody else ""there is a huge choice of free alternatives"".""The influence of Google"" on the consumer market, she says, ""means that Microsoft is not as dominant anymore.""Finally, consumers have ""less of a need to engage with documents"". E-mail and Word documents are losing their importance as more people communicate via social networks such as Twitter and Facebook, and these ""are not documents-based"", says Ms McLeish.Microsoft, however, has a cunning plan. While the full version of Office is still a chunky and pricey piece of software, soon all Office applications will be available through the web. Even better, for consumers they will be free.Microsoft is playing to the strength of its global reach. ""Microsoft Office Web Apps"" will be available to more than 500 million people using free Windows Live services such as Hotmail, online storage Skydrive and Live Messenger. Another boost: under the name Docs.com, the service will be available to all users of Facebook, one of the world's most popular social networking sites.Microsoft's biggest weapon, though, argues Forrester's Sheri McLeish is ""familiarity"", which ""can not be underestimated"". Most people just know how to use Office - although that's true only to a point. With Office 2007, Microsoft introduced a new top-level navigation, a so-called ribbon of commands relevant in the context of what you were working on.What seemed like a good idea turned out to be a major irritation for most. Microsoft has not given up on the concept, though, and rolled out the ribbon across all Office applications, including their online versions.After plenty of refinements, ""we are seeing less and less negative feedback on the ribbon,"" says Per-Olof Schroeder of Microsoft's Office division.Microsoft also hopes to win on quality of service. Yes, Office web apps won't be as powerful as the real applications installed on a computer but they will be better than those offered by rivals, the company claims. Many browser-based applications struggle to maintain the formatting of original documents. Microsoft, in contrast, promises ""high fidelity"" editing and viewing, including an online ""player"" for Powerpoint presentations on computers that don't have this resource-intensive software.But why is Microsoft giving away all this for free?Company executives are shy to answer, but the explanation is obvious: Office 2010 is the ultimate freemium deal - where some basic services are offered for free, while power users are happy to pay a premium.And the power users are corporate clients.Microsoft has taken a page out of Apple's play-book, says Ms McLeish. There is a new generation of computer users growing up. Giving them Office web apps for free makes them familiar with Microsoft products, and ""when they enter the workforce, they will want something they are familiar with"".It also works for existing users. ""The way people work is changing,"" says Mr Schroeder. ""They are working more and more from everywhere... home and the workspace are merging.""That's how we position Office 2010, regardless of how you access it, on your PC or through you browser... you have high-fidelity viewing and a very good user interface,"" says Mr Schroeder.Microsoft's lynchpin is its Sharepoint software, which allows people to share and collaborate on documents. The software, an integral part of the Office 2010 package, is ""going like gangbusters,"" reports Ms McLeish. A third of big enterprises plan to upgrade to Sharepoint 2010 within a year, and that in turn will drive the corporate success of the Office 2010, says Forrester.While ""for the broad masses it's going to be a slow transition"" to the new Office suite, ""for businesses, I'm bullish for the product,"" she says.Of course, Sharepoint is not the only collaboration tool around. Plenty of companies - including Google - offer applications, tools and databases online.It's called ""cloud computing"", but even here Microsoft has the advantage that companies still live overwhelmingly in a Microsoft world. ""The cloud story is coming together for Microsoft, and Office 2010 is a key part of that,"" says Per-Olof Schroeder.And while most consumers will be perfectly happy with the limited features of Docs.com, Mr Schroeder predicts that companies will find themselves in ""a lot of scenarios that require much more advanced capabilities"" - in other words a fully paid-up version of Office 2010.So does Microsoft meet its online/offline promises?Docs.com is still in ""beta"", an invitation-only service with plenty of software bugs. The user interface has a clear, clean look that will make most Office users feel at home. The workflow - where to click, in which order - still needs improving.But Microsoft is clearly very close to delivering a strong challenger to Google Docs, especially when Docs.com is combined with Skydrive, Microsoft's free 25 Gigabyte online storage service. The Office 2010 software itself runs faster than its predecessor and sports many clever improvements (my favourite: a meeting invitation sent to Outlook automatically shows whether it can fit in the diary or not).But Office is still very much a corporate product. Microsoft must hope that its web apps are compelling enough to have future generations clamouring for the Microsoft experience at work.",Microsoft's two-pronged strategy for Office 2010,0

"Technology linked to happiness, study claims","There are positive links between access to technology and feelings of well-being, a study claims.BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, analysed the results of a survey of 35,000 people around the world.Access to communication devices was found to be the most valued.It found that women in developing countries, and people of both sexes with low incomes or poor education, were most influenced emotionally by their access to technology.It is partly because women tend to have a more central role in family and other social networks, said researcher Paul Flatters of Trajectory Partnership, which conducted the research on behalf of the BCS.""Our hypothesis is that women in developing countries benefit more because they are more socially constrained in society,"" he added.""The next phase of our research is to test that.""The study also found that the correlation does not appear to increase with age, despite the efforts of various countries to get their older populations online.""Whether young or old, we're all social beings, we all have a need for the things IT access facilitates,"" said Mr Flatters.The research team's findings contradict the views of psychologists such as Yair Amichai-Hamburger, director of the Research Center for Internet Psychology at the Sammy Ofer School of Communications in Israel.In an opinion column for New Scientist magazine last year, Mr Amichai-Hamburger wrote that technology had a negative impact on people's well-being by blurring professional and personal time.""We need ways to help recover those increasingly large parts of our lives that we have ceded to technology, to regain mastery over technology and learn to use it in a healthy and positive way,"" he said.The results of the BCS study are ""slightly counter-intuitive,"" admitted Mr Flatters.""A lot of things that are written about IT are negative,"" he said. ""But we were puzzled by the fact that people are attached to their IT as well - how do you square that circle?""Ownership of technology is a status symbol in many cultures, according to Kathi Kitner, senior research scientist at Intel.While having a computer is considered synonymous with a good education worldwide, the emerging middle classes of India think it is also a sign of prosperity, she said.""Whether that prosperity in terms of monetary returns actually materialises is not documented, but it is very real in terms of perception,"" she said.","Technology linked to happiness, study claims",0
Eurozone economies post weak growth for start of 2010,"The eurozone economies made a weak start to 2010, posting only modest growth that was lifted by better figures from Italy.Growth to between January and March was 0.2%, after being flat in the previous three months.Compared with the same quarter in 2009, the combined economies of the 16 countries that use the euro grew 0.5%.Throughout the 27-nation EU as a whole, which includes the UK, the first quarter also showed 0.2% growth. The figures, from the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, showed that Greece's economy shrank by 0.8% in first quarter of 2010.Italy reported the fastest growth, of 0.5%, making up for a 0.1% drop over the previous quarter. Germany was in line with the average, with 0.2% growth, although this was higher than some analysts forecast.Spain crawled out of recession with 0.1% growth. France also grew by 0.1%, slowing from 0.5% growth in the previous three months.The figures for the eurozone and whole EU compared unfavourably to first quarter growth of 0.8% for the US.Japan has yet to release its data, but it had already recorded growth of 0.9% in the last three months of 2009.However, analyst Howard Archer, of IHS Global Insight, expects the eurozone's improvement to gain momentum.He said: ""The eurozone's upturn is expected to gradually become more firmly established in 2011, when GDP growth is forecast at 1.5%, helped by a stabilisation and then gradual improvement in labour markets as well as by stronger global growth.""But governments' measures to reduce their budget deficits will cast a cloud over Europe, said Carsten Brzeski, economist at ING.""Austerity programmes in several eurozone countries will weigh on growth in the coming years,"" he said.",Eurozone economies post weak growth for start of 2010,0
Last Ziegfeld Folly dies aged 106,"Doris Eaton Travis, the last surviving dancer from the Ziegfeld Follies troupe, has died in the US aged 106.Travis first performed in the legendary Broadway show famed for its elaborate costumes and dance routines in 1918 aged 14.At the age of 101 the dancer performed in a charity gala at the New York theatre where she made her debut.Broadway is due to dim its lights on Wednesday evening as a mark of respect for the veteran performer.Travis went on to appear in a number of silent Hollywood films in the 1920s and 30s and starred on stage opposite Al Jolson.She continued to dance and sing in a Los Angeles revue, giving the first performance of Singin' In The Rain.In her latter years, Travis also appeared in productions staged for the annual Easter bonnet benefit.She was a dance teacher and a local television celebrity in Detroit.Speaking about her life as a performer in 2005, Travis said: ""I'm sure that the dancing I've done, exercising, has helped me to keep a body that is flexible.She added that her longevity and connection with the Zeigfeld Follies came as a surprise to many people, ""possibly because I'm still walking around"".",Last Ziegfeld Folly dies aged 106,0
Europe to examine case for bigger CO2 cuts,"Europe's climate commissioner Connie Hedegaard is to set out the case for a unilateral 30% EU cut in CO2.At the end of May she will unveil research examining the consequences to Europe's economy of outdoing the current 20% target.She said no position had been taken by Europe on a new unilateral target.But she warned the fall in CO2 during the recession meant a 20% cut would not drive the clean energy innovation Europe needed.She said China was investing almost 10 times as much as the EU in plans for a low-carbon economy.""Europe risks being left behind,"" she said at a lecture in London organised by the International Institute for Environment and Development.She said that due to the recession, it is now a third cheaper to achieve the 20% target than when it was agreed in 2007. ""For an extra 11bn Euros on the sum originally proposed, the EU can now make a 30% CO2 cut [by 2020, based on 1990 levels]"" she said. Her paper will examine the costs and benefits of such a proposal. ""She said it would include benefits like cleaning up local air pollution and energy security - and, crucially, the stimulus it would give to low-carbon innovation in Europe.Ms Hedegaard said a new stimulus was desperately needed. She warned that so many carbon permits had been held unused in the EU, and so many credits were available on the carbon market that firms could carry on with business as usual for the foreseeable future. The EU needed to do something to drive up the carbon price in order to drive invention, she said.Last week a consortium of major European industries issued a statement opposing any plans from the Commission to adopt a 30% CO2 cut without reciprocal  agreements from the US. That is the current EU position. Ms Hedegaard said that sectors facing competition had nothing to fear because the carbon quotas had been arranged to protect their interests.But she did agree that the world needed a binding global deal on emissions. In a passionate speech she urged delegates to the UN climate talks to concentrate on what could be agreed, rather than on areas of disagreement.She hoped that at the climate talks in Cancun in December there might be a UN agreement rubber-stamping parts of the Copenhagen Accord (not supported by all UN members), along with progress in new areas.She hoped the UN would enshrine the principle of shared responsibility for the climate; the target of a 2C maximum increase in temperature; guidance on verifying emissions; adaptation to a changing climate; forestry and fast-start finance.The commissioner admitted that she was worrying that public scepticism about climate change is on the rise in some countries - particularly, she said, the UK. ""The day we have 100pc certainty it's too late to act,"" she said. Commenting on the suggestion from the Hartwell Group that the Kyoto Protocol would not deliver and the carbon markets would not work, she told BBC News: ""Given the huge disappointments of this year it is understandable that some people would say we should find a different approach. ""But I would remind people that we now have all the world's major nations agreeing that they bear a share of the responsibility for protecting the climate and keeping temperature rise below 2C - that would have been inconceivable if you had suggested it a few years ago.""It is too soon to kill off Kyoto. And the carbon markets can provide us with more finance for clean development if we can drive up the carbon price somehow.

The coalition: Business speaks,"Like everyone else, the UK's business lobby groups are trying to work out what this new and unfamiliar form of government could actually deliver. Here is a round-up of some of the key groups' reactions to the new coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats - and their policy requests.""Fixing the public finances must be at the top of the agenda. The Conservative-led coalition must be absolutely clear about where spending cuts will fall, and about the need to curb relentless growth in the size and cost of the public sector. They must also follow through on their promise to roll back the planned employer National Insurance rise in any emergency Budget.""The next 90 days are crucial for recovery. We need concrete proposals to reduce red tape and tax burdens on business; action to move the economy away from consumption and the public sector and towards exports; and commitments to improve Britain's key business infrastructure.""""The agreement between the Conservative and Liberal Democrats to form the next Government is welcome news. Business wants to see a stable government with the authority to take the tough decisions that will be required to keep the economic recovery on track and to get a grip on the fiscal deficit. This coalition should have the votes and the mandate to get on with the job.""In the past few days, leaders of all three of the main political parties have emphasised their commitment to restoring fiscal stability in the national interest. That must be their overriding priority in the months to come.""""The Forum has already set out what it thinks the priorities for the new Government should be in its election manifesto, which has been circulated among prospective MPs and policymakers. Those priorities are: free enterprise, fiscal responsibility, stability, new technologies, new markets and a scrapping of the planned rise in National Insurance contributions.""Britain's manufacturers have urged the new coalition government to move swiftly to set out a credible plan for reducing the public sector deficit and a vision for creating a new economic model and a more balanced economy with a stronger role for manufacturing.  ""This new model of government gives it a great opportunity to think and act differently in how it approaches these major challenges. It is vital that it now grasps it.""   ""The increase in the wider measure of unemployment is a strong reminder to the new chancellor that economic recovery remains fragile. But this does not mean that we should avoid public spending cuts. ""On the contrary, the sooner decisive action is taken to bring expenditure under control, the greater the possibility of acceleration in the recovery. The way to reduce the deficit is by lower spending, not higher taxation. Evidence from around the world shows that raising taxation risks killing the recovery, but at times of fiscal crisis, squeezing spending actually works to strengthen the economy. This is a difficult message to sell, but it is nonetheless the right one.""",The coalition: Business speaks,0
Overdraft rates 'at 10-year high',"Authorised overdraft rates have reached their highest level for a decade, according to financial information service Moneyfacts.The average interest rate on agreed overdrafts has reached 14.22%, the highest since May 2000.The high comes despite the Bank rate remaining at a record low of 0.5%, although some banks have changed overdraft pricing policy.The Bank rate stood at 6% when overdraft costs were last above 14%. Over the last 10 years, authorised overdraft rates dropped to 11.81% at their lowest point in May 2004, the Moneyfacts research shows.However, during debate and court cases regarding unauthorised overdraft fees, some banks changed the structure of the way they charge people who go overdrawn.This has reduced the income some receive from people who go into the red without permission.""Changes made to reduced unauthorised borrowing charges meant banks lost a significant revenue stream, something they can ill afford in the current climate,"" said Michelle Slade of Moneyfacts.""As one revenue stream closed, inevitably they have moved to find another. ""The loss of income gained from a minority of customers is now being recouped from all customers who use an agreed overdraft.""Banks are likely to be making more now from these increases than they ever were from penalty charges.""However, the British Bankers' Association (BBA), which represents the banks, has branded the theory as too simplistic.""[Moneyfacts] are comparing interest rates today with interest rates during the easy credit era,"" a BBA spokesman said.""The interest rate offered during that period and cost of banking was unsustainable. The economics of the industry has changed.""To point out one factor as the main influence on pricing makes no sense.""Andrew Hagger, of financial website Moneynet.co.uk, argued that charges levied when people go overdrawn without permission were still a bigger issue for consumers.If someone with an agreed overdraft was charged at a market average of 14% and they were £500 overdrawn for 15 days each month, they would pay interest charges of £2.87 per month, he said. If their interest rate was increased by 2%, it would mean having to pay an extra 41p every month.""These charges pale into insignificance when compared to the unauthorised charging structures currently employed by some of the banks,"" he said.""The area that really needs more focus is unauthorised charging, where a £50 unauthorised overdraft for just three days can cost a customer up to £60 for what is a short-term and fairly minor financial indiscretion.""

UK economic growth 'to be revised up',"The UK economy grew by 0.5% between February and April, the National Institute of Social and Economic Research (Niesr) has said. That is up from the 0.2% growth both it and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated for the first three months of the year. The leading think tank said it now expected the ONS to upgrade its first-quarter official growth estimate. It added that the weak pound had also started helping the economy. ""The competitive situation in which the UK economy finds itself following the exchange rate adjustments of the last two years is beginning to have a favourable effect on output,"" said Niesr's director Martin Weale. A weaker pound typically helps UK exporters, as their products become cheaper for foreign buyers. But Mr Weale added that a weak recovery was still on the cards. ""A further acceleration of growth is needed if progress is to be made in closing the output gap which has opened up since the start of the depression in March 2008,"" he said.A rise in industrial output is also expected to have boosted GDP. Earlier the ONS reported 2% rise in industrial output for March - much stronger than anticipated by many analysts. The official statistics body said it now expected to revise its estimate for first-quarter growth up to 0.3%, all else being equal.",UK economic growth 'to be revised up',0

Egyptian ministry officials jailed over Van Gogh theft,"An Egyptian court has found 11 culture ministry employees guilty of negligence, after the theft of a Van Gogh painting from a Cairo museum.  The officials include Deputy Culture Minister Mohsen Shalan, and the museum's director.They have been sentenced to three years in jail but each given bail of about $1,750 (£1,100), pending an appeal. The Van Gogh painting was stolen in broad daylight from the Mahmud Khalil museum on 21 August.The work - known as both ""Poppy Flowers"" and ""Vase and Flowers"" - was cut out of its frame.It is valued at more than $50m (£32m).The investigation found that none of the museum's alarms and only seven of 43 security cameras were working. In addition, the museum had reduced its security personnel, meaning that often there was only one guard on duty. During the course of the trial, a number of museum officials said they had known about security problems but they were given no budget to improve things.Mr Shalan, who heads the department of fine arts, said he had asked the culture minister for nearly $7m (£4.4m) to upgrade security systems, including those at the Mahmud Khalil museum. He said only $88,000 (£56,000) was approved.  Culture Minister Farouk Hosni testified during the trial and dismissed his subordinates' complaints.The missing work is believed to have been painted by Vincent Van Gogh in 1887, three years before his death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Egyptian billionaire Naguib Sawiris has offered a $175,000 (£110,000) reward for information leading to the recovery of the painting, but it is still missing.",Egyptian ministry officials jailed over Van Gogh theft,0

EU wants member countries to co-ordinate budgets,"The European Commission wants EU countries to co-ordinate plans for national budgets in a move to strengthen financial co-operation.It would involve submitting budgets to the EU for a ""peer review"", possibly before they go to national parliaments.Some reports suggested the proposal would involve just the 16 countries using the euro currency, though this has not been made clear.The Commission said its aim was to help prevent another EU financial crisis.But the move, controversial as it would mean encroaching on sovereign territory, was immediately criticised by Sweden's prime minister.The EC statement said: ""The Commission proposes to reinforce decisively the economic governance in the European Union [which has 27 members].""An early peer review of fiscal policies would help shape a fiscal stance for the EU and the euro area as a whole. ""Union countries should begin co-ordinating preparations for national budgets and economic reforms.""Member states would benefit from early coordination at European level as they prepare their national budgets and national reform programmes,"" the statement said.Olli Rehn, Europe's economic and monetary affairs commissioner, appeared to suggest that the measures applied to eurozone countries.He said: ""Coordination of fiscal policy has to be conducted in advance, in order to ensure that national budgets are consistent with the European dimension, that they don't put at risk the stability of the other member states.""And he added: ""For [the] euro-area it means deeper and broader surveillance, in particular with regard to macroeconomic imbalances."" No one in Mr Rehn's office was available for clarification.Sweden's prime minister, Fredrik Reinfeldt, opposed any tighter surveillance on his country. ""That this should concern all countries is something we find a little strange,"" he told a press conference.""This kind of discussion could perhaps be possible for [countries] with a budget policy that goes against the [EU] stability and growth pact,"" he said.""But countries like Sweden, we are a shining exception with good public finances and don't even come close to the limits one is not permitted to surpass.

US trade deficit widens as recovery gathers pace,"The US trade deficit rose to a 15-month high in March as rising imports underlined the economy's recovery.Figures from the Commerce Department showed the gap between imports and exports rose 2.5% to $40.4bn.A higher deficit suggests that the pace of corporate and consumer demand is growing following the recession.However, economists said the outlook for US exports was curtailed by Europe's debt crisis, where latest figures show slow economic growth.Imports of goods and services were up 3.1% to $188.3bn in March, while exports rose 3.2% to $147.87bn.The recent weakness of the dollar helped US manufacturers boost exports. However, the economic crisis in Europe could hinder demand and lead to a strengthening of the dollar.""The outlook for exports has been dampened by the fiscal crisis in Europe, which has reduced the prospects for overseas activity,"" said Paul Dales, senior economist at Capital Economics.The 16 European states in the eurozone, which include struggling Greece, account for 15% of US exports.The deficit with the 27-nation European Union rose to $7.1bn in March, a 32.7% jump. So far this year, the US deficit is running at an annual rate of $467.2bn, 23.4% higher than last year's imbalance of $378.6bn.The increase in imports was led by a 25.5% rise in crude shipments, which rose to $22.3bn in March. Although the price of oil has risen, so has the volume of US imports.The Commerce Department said exports of farm products and heavy machinery were particularly strong in March.The deficit with China rose 2.4% to $16.9bn in March, the highest level since January and the largest trade gap with any country. US manufacturers are urging President Barack Obama to press Beijing to change its currency strategy.Companies claim that China's currency manipulation is making US exports more expensive.

Black hole 'hurled out of galaxy',"A supermassive black hole may have been observed in the process of being hurled from its parent galaxy at high speed.The finding comes from analysis of data collected by the US Chandra space X-ray observatory.However, there are alternative explanations for the observation.The work, by an international team of astronomers, has been published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.Normally, each galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its centre.Given that these objects can have masses equivalent to one billion Suns, it takes a special set of conditions to cause this to happen.The authors believe this could be the result of the merger of two smaller black holes. But there are alternative explanations for the bright X-ray source; it could also be a Type IIn supernova, or an ultra-luminous X-ray source (ULX) with an optical counterpart (which could represent several phenomena).Simulations using supercomputers suggest that when this happens, the larger black hole that results is shot away at high speed. However, this depends on the direction and velocity at which the two black holes are rotating before their collision.Marianne Heida of the University of Utrecht used data in the Chandra Source Catalogue to compare hundreds of thousands of sources of X-rays with the positions of millions of galaxies.The material that falls into black holes heats up dramatically on its final journey, which often means that black holes are strong X-ray sources.X-rays are also able to penetrate the dust and gas that obscures the centre of a galaxy, giving astronomers a clear view of the region around the black hole, with the bright source appearing as a star-like point. Looking at one galaxy in the Catalogue, Ms Heida noticed that the point of light was offset from the centre and yet was so bright that it could be associated with a supermassive black hole.Ms Heida said: ""We have found many more objects in this strange class of X-ray sources. With Chandra we should be able to make the accurate measurements we need to pinpoint them more precisely and identify their nature.""",Black hole 'hurled out of galaxy',0
Largest tidal power device unveiled,"A device thought to be the largest tidal turbine of its type to be built in the world has been described by its developer as ""simple and robust"".Atlantis Resources unveiled its AK1000 at Invergordon ahead of it being shipped to a European Marine Energy Centre test site off Eday, Orkney.Chief executive Tim Cornelius said it was designed to survive in a harsh marine environment.The device stands 22.5m (73ft) tall and weighs 1,300 tonnes.It has two sets of blades on a single unit to harness ebb and flood tides and could generate one megawatt of power - enough electricity for about 1,000 homes.Atlantis said it was the largest bladed turbine of its type because of its rotor diameter of 18m (59ft).Mr Cornelius told BBC Scotland that the focus of the marine industry at the moment was making the Pentland Firth a huge success in terms of generating electricity from renewable energy devices.The Crown Estate has selected developers to start the process.Mr Cornelius said: ""It is one of the harshest environments on the planet.""In order to get a robust turbine we have had to make what we call ultimately the dumbest, simple but most robust turbine you could possibly put in such a harsh environment.""The AK1000's two sets of blades have also been designed to move slowly underwater and Atlantis said they would not pose a threat to sea life.Mr Cornelius said: ""The turbines turn at six to eight revolutions per minute so are incredibly slow turning and will have zero impact on the surrounding environment.""Following final assembly at a yard in Evanton, the AK1000 has been moved to nearby docks at Invergordon on the Cromarty Firth.Atlantis, which has bases in London and Singapore, has been leading a plan to use tidal energy to power a computer data centre in the far north of Scotland.Earlier this year, the corporation said it remained committed to the project.The computer data centre would provide services for a number of companies and be powered by tidal energy rather than depend on electricity supplied to the National Grid. Atlantis did not apply for the first round of leases for renewable energy sites in the Pentland Firth that were granted by the Crown Estate in March. But Mr Cornelius said the company proposed bidding when other locations were made available. Two years of planning have gone into the data facility and tidal scheme.

""Over the last few days, more lenders have reduced their mortgage rates in an effort to attract more business including Nationwide, Abbey, Northern Rock and a number of building societies.""Virtually all lenders require mortgages over 75% loan to value (LTV) to be on a repayment-only basis - that's why the Post Office rates would be so different,"" he added.The new 90% loan is part of a revamped range of mortgages from the Post Office .It started lending in 2007 on a trial basis, but committed itself fully to the mortgage market last October.""We are looking to be one of the top 10 lenders in the UK,"" said a spokeswoman.The Post Office loans, which can be applied for by post, internet and phone or at its branches, are financed by the Bank of Ireland, with which the Post Office has a joint venture.The average deposit on a UK house purchase still stands at 25%, a level it has been at since the credit crunch and banking crisis of 2007 and 2008 forced lenders to start rationing their loans.That level of downpayment is still required for 57% of all current mortgage deals on offer.However, the gentle easing of rationing in the mortgage market since the start of the year means there are now more than 160 deals available that ask for just a 10% deposit.""Whilst there are existing 90% deals available, many remain out of reach for most borrowers because the rates are too high,"" said the Post Office's director of personal lending, Marco Hughes.""Instead, we're offering more affordable rates that will allow more borrowers the opportunity to take out a mortgage with a smaller deposit.""The interest charged by the Post Office on its two-year fixed rate, at 90% LTV, is 5.45%.However, its base-rate tracker at 5.49% is set at a margin of 4.99% over the Bank of England's base rate, with no cap or ceiling.A spokeswoman explained that while being offered ""interest only"" deals, borrowers would still have to show they could eventually repay the capital as well.""We ask all the usual questions any responsible provider would, for example assessing the value of the property, credit history, employment status and salary, plus customers are required to provide details of their repayment plan in order to ensure the loan can be repaid,"" she said.  ""Importantly, each application with the Post Office will be manually underwritten which means it is assessed by a fully qualified human being, not a computer,"" she added.Meanwhile the Lloyds banking group, which includes the Halifax, has stopped offering interest-only home loans worth more than half a million pounds.The lender will now lend sums of this size on a repayment basis only.And it will no longer accept the promised sale of the house or business, or prospective inheritance, as proper repayment methods for any size of interest-only loan.""We have recently undertaken a strategic review of interest only to ensure our products and procedures reflect the additional risks and responsibilities associated with this type of lending,"" the lender said in a message to mortgage  brokers.""It is important that repayment vehicles can provide certainty of their future value,"" it added.

Simon Cowell replacement 'not imminent' on US Idol show,"A replacement for Simon Cowell on the American Idol judging panel will not be announced until after the 26 May season finale, according to reports.Entertainment Weekly said there would be no announcement at a 17 May autumn schedule presentation given by the show's makers Fox to advertisers.Sir Elton John is among stars rumoured to be in the frame to replace Cowell, who will work on the American X Factor.Meanwhile, the American Idol website is asking fans their views on the show.Entertainment Weekly said the timings of an announcement had been confirmed by ""a show source"".It said an earlier announcement would have taken the spotlight away from both the contestants and Cowell's role in the season finale.The uncertainty would ""score plenty of free publicity as debate over Cowell 2.0 turns into a popular summer sport"", it added.On Tuesday, Thomas Benson, the chief financial officer of CKX Inc - which owns production company 19 Entertainment - told The Hollywood Reporter that work continued ""on a replacement strategy for Simon Cowell"".In the website survey, Fox asks fans their opinions on the judging skills of individual members of the panel including chat show host Ellen Degeneres, who joined the show this season.It also asks viewers if they miss former judge Paula Abdul, if they watched the show more or less than they used to and what they thought of guest judges from the current season, which included Victoria Beckham.Chris Glover, writing on a blog on the Seattle Times website, asks if the show is ""headed for oblivion"".""The ratings are down, that weird celebrity dancing program is doing better, and the face of the show, Simon Cowell, is about to leave for good,"" he writes.""Only the truly desperate ask the public for help in deciding how the show will work.""Jere Hester, writing on the NBC website, said the survey was a ""smart move"" and that producers were trying ""to figure out what's gone wrong this season, perhaps the weakest yet"".""Though the show remains TV's number one programme, the ratings are down, making the judges' panel a natural target,"" he said.But the season had mainly been hampered by ""a mediocre contestant line-up"", he added.",Simon Cowell replacement 'not imminent' on US Idol show,0
Tim Burton sensitive about Cannes judge role,"With his trademark dark glasses and scruffy hairstyle Tim Burton enters a room of journalists to a round of applause.The 51-year-old director, who is best known for making big budget fantasy films such as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and more recently Alice In Wonderland, is the man hand-picked to head up this year's Palme d'Or jury.There are 19 movies to be judged this year and Burton, along with eight other judges including actors Kate Beckinsale and Benicio Del Toro, must sit through all of them - at least once - before announcing the winner. But for Burton, who knows what it feels like to be judged in the competition after his 1994 movie Ed Wood was nominated, says he is not comfortable with the title of his current role.""I think we're all very sensitive to being called judges,"" he says.""I think that's what the great thing about this group is, we want to view every film with a generosity. Also because we're judges, we'll be judged as judges.""On Tuesday night, the panel of nine met over dinner to become acquainted and to set out their schedule for the next 11 days. ""The goal is to not have any preconceptions, I think we've all been judged, so I think we're coming into this with a certain spirit and openness and hopefully compassion for any filmmaker,"" Burton says.""We've all been involved in it [film-making] and we all know what that's all about. We all like to be surprised, so there are no preconceptions; we don't want to have a 'certain kind of thing' that we're looking for.""The star, who insists he will not make any of his fellow judges get up early to view films during their stay, adds: ""The point is to feel the films and discuss how they touch us both intellectually and emotionally."" There is a wide variety of films in competition this year from all over the world including Thai film Lung Boonmee Raluek Chat,  French movie Tournee about a group of Burlesque dancers travelling around France and Utomlyonnye Solntsem 2 by Russian director Nikita Mikhalkov.Britain's offering Another Year by Mike Leigh, which stars Oscar-winning actor Jim Broadbent and explores various different themes, including joy, sadness, hope and despair. There are also films from south Korea, Spain, Italy, US, Algeria and China.""This is what this film festival is all about, people from different countries and different walks of life - that's the exciting part about it,"" Burton says.""Hopefully we'll be enjoying the films and enjoying the discussions we have. I think we're all in the spirit of letting the films affect us. Burton, who is known for his visually arresting and off-kilter film style, says he is revelling in the fact that none of the films in competition are anything like the movies he makes.  ""What I'm excited about is seeing a type of a film that I wouldn't ordinarily make or be involved with, but again, that's the beauty of cinema - to see things that are not in your sphere."" When asked how he felt about the lack of Hollywood films in the selection, he says: ""I'm happy about that"".""This is an opportunity for me to see what's going on in cinema and that's what has excited each and every one of us. The element of surprise is something you're always looking for.""From the beginning of cinema it's always been about what's touched people. Whether it's a big effects movie or a small intimate movie - it's what affects people.  I hope and believe that will always be the case.""This process that we go through is a journey and there are certain things that we have to do. It's very organic in the sense that you see things, you discuss it and it's great if you can try to come up with a consensus. ""At the same time, I think that's the fun and interesting part of this process is to make it like a journey - you know where you have to get to, but you're not quite sure how to get there.

Robin Hood baddie swoops on Cannes,"""As an actor it's one of the greatest moments going up the red carpet at Cannes, it's one of the things you like to say you've done,"" says Mark Strong.The 46-year-old actor stars alongside Russell Crowe in one of this summer's blockbuster movies Robin Hood.The film, which has been directed by Sir Ridley Scott and sees the film-maker team up once again with his Oscar-winning Gladiator star Crowe, will open this year's Film Festival.""It's wonderful the film has been chosen. It is an honour and means that it is taken seriously as a movie, so more people will be aware of it,"" he says.""That's wonderful for the film-makers that they've got that exposure and endorsement from such a famous film festival.""Strong plays Sir Godfrey, a character based on the original baddie Guy of Gisborne.He is no stranger to playing a villain, as he was also cast as the bad guy in the recent superhero film Kick-Ass and in Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, but Strong insists he ""enjoys"" the dark roles.""They're good fun, they get great lines and they usually get to wear great clothes,"" he laughs.It is not the first time Strong has worked with Sir Ridley. In 2008, on the set of Body of Lies, Strong said he was approached by the director himself about Robin Hood.""He basically said to me that he was making this film and hadn't decided on the script and asked me how I felt about it. I said: 'I don't need a script I'm in'.""The fact was I just wanted to work with Ridley again because he's one of the greatest film-makers. That in itself was reason enough.""Since the announcement was made that Sir Ridley was planning a Robin Hood remake, it seemed the film was plagued with problems.The title changed, casting amended and scripts completely reworked, but Strong says that is all part of making a film.""Normally, we wouldn't know about changes like that because they would all take place before the script was released and before the filming had started. ""But because there was such a long gestation period a lot of things that would normally not be known about became public knowledge,"" he explains.When asked what makes Sir Ridley such a great director, Strong says it is his ""experience and incredible appetite"".Strong says he was also more than happy to team up with Crowe again, who he calls ""polite, very generous and extremely good company"".Crowe has gained a reputation over the years for being difficult both on and off set. ""People seem to think Russell has a temper, I don't know if that's true because I've never been on the end of it. You have to take as you find.""I really like the guy, he was very generous during filming. He even helped somebody out when their car crashed or broke down and gave them some money to help them get a new one.""When asked why he thinks Crowe gets all the headlines, Strong says: ""It makes good copy if you can find a terrible story about him.""The pair spent a lot of time together on set crafting their final fight scenes, which Strong likens to a ""dance sequence"".The climax of the film ends on the coast with a huge battle scene and the pair fighting in water.""There were 1,500 people being catered for lunch on that set, including crew, stunt men, horse riders, extras and you really got the sense that you were in a massive movie,"" Strong says.The physical aspects of shooting the movie were tough, as the actors costumes consisted of seven layers, including authentic chain mail armour.But Strong revelled in the brutal training and says he loved improving his horse-riding skills. ""You needed to control the horse and be quite skillful, as well as ride one-handed, whilst slashing people left, right and centre, I really enjoyed that,"" he says.With hundreds of film journalists descending upon Cannes, many will be anticipating Sir Ridley's next big blockbuster with Crowe.The reviews will be out days after it is screened, but Strong reveals he is never fazed by what is written.""If they pass under my nose I'll read them but I don't actively seek them out and use them as a yard stick, because it's only one person's opinion,"" he says.""Everyone has to have their own relationship with a film. Some people love Russell and some people don't love Russell. Some people might love Kick-Ass, a film I've just done, but might not like Robin Hood, but I don't get hung up about stuff like that.""Robin Hood is scheduled to be released in UK cinemas on 12 May",Robin Hood baddie swoops on Cannes,0
Microsoft Office 2010 takes aim at Google Docs,"Microsoft has unleashed its latest weapon in its ongoing battle with Google. The software giant has launched its flagship product Office 2010, aimed at businesses and home users.The latest version of the software has a free online component - called Office Web Apps.Analysts believe the web offering is a response to Google, which has been encroaching on Microsoft's core business with its free online tools.Crucially, Microsoft will also offer its online office suite to all users of one of the world's most popular social networking sites, Facebook. ""There's no question - Microsoft is responding to Google's threat,"" said Whit Andrews, analyst at research firm Gartner.Google and Microsoft have increasingly begun to stray into each other's traditional markets. Microsoft has thrown its full weight behind its search engine Bing, whilst Google is about to launch its own operating system, known as Chrome OS.The battle for the Office software market started in 2006 when the search giant launched the first elements of its Google Docs. ""Until Google emerged with a credible suite of networked applications, Microsoft was not compelled to do anything."" Google Docs now offers word-processing, spreadsheet software and a presentation tool, amongst others. Businesses can pay for premium versions.""Each release of Office has a new set of competitors and we take those very seriously,"" Jeff Teper, vice president of the Microsoft Business Division told BBC News. ""[Google] has introduced a product that they have tried to target businesses with - it hasn't done very well.""Google Docs currently has a small (4%) but growing share of the market.  By contrast, Microsoft dominates the office software space, with a market share of more than 94%, according to Gartner. The vast majority of sales are to businesses. Business ""is still overwhelmingly a Microsoft world"", said Sheri McLeish, analyst at Forrester Research. Microsoft retains its dominant position despite the free offerings from Google and other alternatives such as Zoho or the free office suite OpenOffice.org.Ahead of Microsoft's launch Google posted a blog urging businesses to switch to its software, claiming that it represents a real alternative"".""If you're considering upgrading Office with Office, we'd encourage you to consider an alternative: upgrading Office with Google Docs,"" it read. Despite, Google's focus on businesses, Mr Andrews said its message and software were likely to appeal to younger people, who have not necessarily grown up using Microsoft products. ""If all your content is generated in the Google apps system and it lives there, you would need to have a really good reason to move,"" he told BBC News. Office Web Apps offers a free version of programs such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint.The service allows people to access and edit documents from within a web browser, as well as share and collaborate on files. It lacks the entire gamut of features found in the desktop versions, but is designed, in part, to entice consumers to try Microsoft's products, said Mr Teper. ""One of the reasons why we are so excited about the Office Web applications for free...is the appeal to consumers; to get new people to try the latest versions."" Microsoft has said that the suite will be offered free to its 400 million Windows Live users.  ""It is critical that Microsoft captures users who are not tethered to the same desktop PC every day,"" said Mr Andrews. ""They need to be able to serve the growing netbook community and people using their phones.""The firm has also integrated the social web into its software in a bid to attract new customers and keep the desktop software relevant in an increasingly online world. Its Social Connector service allows people to suck information from social networks such as LinkedIn and MySpace into the Office Outlook e-mail program. The firm has also released a trial version of its online apps that integrates with Facebook.""With the changes that have happened with social networking and web applications, Microsoft is bringing [Office] up to the present day,"" said Ms McLeish.The software for PCs and phones was launched at an event in New York on 12 May. Business customers will be able to use it straight away, whilst home users in the UK will have to wait until 15 June to buy the full version. ",Microsoft Office 2010 takes aim at Google Docs,0
Cash-strapped entrepreneurs get creative,"Got a great business idea but no money to finance it? It's the age old problem faced by would-be entrepreneurs. But a new generation of online funding platforms is taking the pain out of raising capital to get new ventures off the ground. The platforms cater for everyone from starving artists to tech start-ups. They allow anyone with a business proposition to post an online pitch which goes straight into the offices and homes of potential investors and donors across the world. When Los Angeles-based design students Jesse Genet, 22, and Stephan Angoulvant, 24, needed to raise $12,000 (£8,000) to launch Lumi Co, a printing and design company, they decided to bypass traditional avenues and cut out the middle men.They registered with Kickstarter.com, a site aimed at anyone in the creative industries. ""Kickstarter seemed like a really good match for our product. It allows anyone with a creative dream to make it a reality,"" says Angoulvant.The creators of every project must set a cash goal and a time limit, though there is no limit on how much people can raise. If they reach the goal within the time limit they get to keep the pledges. If they don't, all pledges are returned. Kickstarter takes 5% commission on all projects which are successfully funded. Crucially, the owners of all businesses and projects funded through the site keep 100% ownership of their ventures.The incentive for backers is both altruistic and actual. ""Everyone must offer a system of rewards,"" says Kickstarter co-founder Perry Chen. ""It's not about philanthropy or charity. It's about patronage and commerce.""Genet and Angoulvant surpassed their fundraising goal, securing $13,598 from people who pledged anything from $1 to over $1,000. As an incentive they offered backers gifts from their range including wallets and bags.The feedback the young entrepreneurs received from would-be investors enabled them to refine their products and gave them lots of ideas for their business going forward. It also provided them with a ready made group of potential customers.The 650 projects which have so far succeeded in meeting their funding goals through Kickstarter include a woman who is circumnavigating the globe solo by boat, a band recording their first CD and a cartoonist travelling to Afghanistan to do political sketches.Since Kickstarter was launched by five friends in April 2009, pledges have come in from 70,000 people around the world.Feedthemuse.net is the brainchild of a group of Philadelphia-based music industry professionals. It is popular among musicians and other creatives who accept pledges from as little as $1. The majority of pledges to fund new CDs and tours have come from friends, families and fans. Taking a more traditional investor/entrepreneur approach is Grow VC. Founded in February by Jouko Ahvenainen and Valto Loikkanen, Grow VC bills itself as the first global crowdfunding tool for web and mobile start-ups. Through the site, start-ups can secure initial funding ranging from $10,000 to $1m.The site has 2,500 registered users in 108 countries worldwide. Some 25% of Grow VC users are in the US, 11% in the UK and 7% in India.  ""From the start we knew we wanted to make it very international so that investors and start-ups around the world could connect with each other,"" says Ahvenainen. The total capital raised through the site so far is $12.8m.Entrepreneurs using Grow VC include Eric Cheng, the chief executive of Hong Kong gaming company Emagist.""Venture capitalists here are looking for big companies,"" says Cheng. ""Grow VC appealed to us because it is very international and it is for small companies.""Within a few months, Emagist outgrew the site. But through Grow VC it made contact with venture capitalists in Europe, the US and mainland China. Along with professional investors, a growing number of ordinary people with an interest in investing have been logging on to Grow VC. Petra Soderling heard about Grow VC on Twitter and is making the minimum Grow VC investment of $20 a month. ""For me it's about investing and hoping to see a profit but also about using a small amount of money to help small companies,"" she says.Not everyone is successful. Among those who failed are New York-based Englishman Toby Daniels. His business idea, Betacup, seeks to reduce the amount of landfill in the US resulting from disposable coffee cups. Although he did not reach his funding goal, Starbucks heard about what he was trying to do on Kickstarter and offered to donate the $20,000 needed to get his plans off the ground. ""This would never have happened if we hadn't made contact with a small but engaged group on the site who got our story out there,"" says Daniels. Kickstarter co-founder Perry Chen believes these new funding tools have a lot of potential for growth. ""You are reaching out to your audience in a very new way which is very involving and makes them feel a strong connection,"" he says. ""We might not be ready for Avatar 2 but the scope is huge.""

World Cup: To tax or not to tax," The BBC can reveal, for the first time, the full scale of the remarkable tax concessions that the world football authority Fifa demands of countries that wish to host a World Cup competition.This Friday, 14 May, in Zurich in Switzerland, representatives of footballing countries around the world will submit their bids to host either the 2018 or 2022 tournaments.The bidding nations have been asked to comply with a wide variety of conditions that Fifa has laid down - and which it would like to keep confidential.Among them is that the entire event should be free of tax for Fifa.""Any host country requires a comprehensive tax exemption to be given to Fifa and further parties involved in the hosting and staging of an event,"" said a Fifa spokesman.This means that to be successful in its bid, the UK government must agree to forgo tens of millions of pounds in tax for the benefit of Fifa, which - as a charitable organisation - pays hardly any tax to its home country of Switzerland.It also appears to mean that the tournament income of the players, some of whom are among the highest paid earners in the world, should also be exempt from tax.The decision on where the 2018 and 2022 competitions are to be staged will be taken by Fifa in December, after considering the huge Bid Books that the contending nations are about to submit.These will contain the details of how, exactly, the would-be hosts propose to go about organising such a massive event.They will have to comply with eight government guarantees,  which the UK government signed last December in support of England's bid.Do they involve relieving the players, possibly even those already resident in the UK, from paying tax on their incomes?""I'm not able to tell you,"" said a spokesman for the England 2018 bid team. ""Fifa requires it [the technical bid document] to remain confidential.""But he stressed that this applied to all conditions, including those applying to visas, work permits, travel, security, banking and foreign currency, commercial rights and broadcasting. ""It is not a selective confidentiality,"" he said.A spokesman for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said: ""I can't go into detail of any of that because Fifa have very strict confidentiality clauses - but there is always room for manoeuvre.""What does the former sports minister Gerry Sutcliffe say? ""Fifa require that details of the guarantees not be made public,"" he told me.""If I did that it would damage the bid and I am not prepared to do that.""Not all bidders feel so bound by this confidentiality.  Holland and Belgium have a joint bid to host the 2018 or 2022 World Cup.The Dutch government recently published all eight government guarantees on its official website, in the form of a draft letter to Fifa President Sepp Blatter.Guarantee no.3 requires ""Full tax exemption of Fifa and Fifa subsidiaries"" and ""is not limited to the events and is not limited time-wise.""""The exemption stated in this section shall encompass all revenues, profits, income, expenses, costs, investments and any and all kind of payments, in cash or otherwise, including through (i) the delivery of goods or services, (ii) accounting credits, (iii) other deliveries, (iv) applications, or (v) remittances, made by or to Fifa and/or Fifa subsidiaries,"" the letter says.This exemption also applies to associated bodies such as the local organising committee; Fifa confederations; Fifa member associations including the hosting association; the host broadcaster; and Fifa service providers.That applies so long as the potential tax relates directly or indirectly to the World Cup and any of its associated events.Intriguingly, the document does not directly mention the most high-profile participants in the World Cup - the players.But the Dutch exemption for individuals seems all-encompassing:""Individuals employed or otherwise hired by Fifa a Fifa subsidiary the local organising committee (LOC)Fifa confederations Fifa member associations Fifa host broadcasters Fifa service providers regardless whether these individuals are deemed as tax residents in the Netherlands or not, shall not be subject to payment of individuals taxes onpayments fringe benefitsreimbursements and any other sort of compensation received from one of the entities above which is not resident in the Netherlands but only as regards to payments, fringe benefits, reimbursements and any other sort of compensation received until December 31 of the second year following the year of the competitions.""It is not a foregone conclusion that all taxes will be avoided during the 2018 or 2022 World Cups, should they be staged in England.After the 2006 World Cup, the German football association (DFB) paid 101 million Euros (£87.8m at current exchange rates) in various taxes on its activities during the tournament.Germany also taxed the non-resident players and trainers as normal, charging them 21.1% on their football fees and bonuses, and other commercial earnings; for instance from appearing in adverts.That raised just over seven million Euros (£6.1m). Everyone else from abroad who was officially accredited to the competition was exempted from German income or corporation tax, although VAT was applied to sales and services as normal.The German government's official report into the way it organised the 2006 event reveals that as many as 170,000 foreigners were given permits to work in the country as part of the competition.A spokesman said this did not equate exactly to the number exempted from tax; no exact figure is available. But it clearly suggests that tens of thousands of people benefited from Fifa's tax requirements.Meanwhile the Brazilian government, already awarded the 2014 World Cup, has just agreed that Fifa and its partners can be exempt from taxes on any goods and services related to the tournament for five years; from January 2011 until the end of 2015.""Brazil stands to win a lot more by the stimulating effect on the economy,"" said the Brazilian sports minister Orlando Silva last month.        When a law is passed by the country's Congress, an exemption from personal income tax will also apply to non-residents who are employed, or in some way contracted, in organising or taking part in the World Cup. ""This exemption will also apply to referees, players and other members of national delegations, but only with regard to the receipt of payments directly related to the events,"" said a spokesman for the Receita Federal (Federal Revenue), the Brazilian tax authority.In this year's competition in South Africa, a ""tax-free bubble"" has been established around the tournament at Fifa's request, relieving Fifa, its subsidiaries, and foreign football associations which are taking part, of income tax, customs duties, and VAT.This also applies to the various organisations designated as Fifa's commercial affiliates, licensees, host broadcasters, broadcast rights agencies, merchandise partners, service providers, concession operators and providers of hospitality.For these organisations the tax concessions only apply when the goods or services are provided at an official Fifa site. A standard 15% tax on the earnings of foreign sportsmen and entertainers will be applied as normal and ticket sales will have 14% VAT applied.So how much money may go untaxed if a World Cup is staged in the UK?No one can tell yet, but Fifa's accounts for 2007, which cover the previous year's World Cup, give a flavour of the huge amounts of money that sloshed around.Nearly 900 million Swiss Francs (£552m at current exchange rates) were spent by Fifa on organising the tournament, including prize money and preparation payments for participating teams, on their hotel and travelling costs, and in a subsidy to the organising committee.Much of that might have been taxed in Germany had it not been for the tournament's favourable tax arrangements.Meanwhile Fifa accrued more than 2.8 billion Swiss Francs (£1.72bn) in the four years up to and including the competition, mainly from selling broadcasting rights, sponsorship, hospitality packages and licensing rights in advance, plus a share of the local organising committee's eventual profits from the tournament.Much of that will have gone directly to Fifa in Switzerland, outside the scope of the German tax net.How much income tax did Fifa pay in 2006 locally? Just one million Swiss Francs (£613,500).  The authorities in the UK may be shy about talking about Fifa's demands now, but if they wish to comply they will eventually have to change UK tax law, and do so in public.The government has agreed this sort of thing before.The 2006 Budget exempted overseas sportsmen and women from being taxed here during the 2012 London Olympics. The London Organising Committee is exempt from corporation tax, the International Olympic Committee is exempt from income and capital gains tax as well, and foreign competitors and staff are covered by this too.A little-noticed, one line, clause in this year's Budget exempted foreign players, and officials, of teams competing in the 2011 Champions League final at Wembley from paying income tax.This fulfilled a government promise made in 2008 in response to the demands of the European football authority Uefa.Should we care?Moray Wilson, from the professional advisory firm Deloitte in Cape Town, says the financing of this year's competition has still stirred up a fair bit of public debate in South Africa.He points to taxpayers' money being used to build new stadiums while untaxed profits largely go to Fifa in Switzerland.""The host government has given away almost the entire tax-take to Fifa,"" he says.""It is certainly taking the lion's share of the revenue.""There is a degree of suspicion in the minds of many people of global organisations who extract extensive concessions from the host government,"" he adds.",World Cup: To tax or not to tax,0
Sprinter Matthew Thomas branded 'common criminal',"A sprinter who raced in national competitions while signed off sick has been branded a ""common criminal"" by a judge for defrauding his employers.Matthew Thomas, 34, was given a four month jail term suspended for two years, at Inner London Crown Court.He was also ordered to repay nearly £12,000 he had taken from his employer, Newham Council.Thomas, of Purley Bury Avenue, Purley, Croydon, south London, was found guilty of seven counts of fraud in August.Judge Nigel Gerald told Thomas: ""You were a person of previous good character, held in esteem by your community.""You have stated your concerns that you have now been branded as a common criminal, but that is because that is what you are.""He was also ordered to carry out 250 hours of unpaid work and to pay £8,000 in costs.Thomas competed and held coaching sessions for youths between November 2007 and June 2008.The Newham Council payroll officer was paid £13,892.12 while on sick leave. The jury had been shown video footage of the defendant running while signed off work.He was caught on camera training youngsters at Croydon athletics track in April 2008 and was filmed again in May 2008 as he undertook sprints at Crystal Palace.He also coached youngsters through the Metropolitan Police's Met-Track scheme before resigning from the role in June 2008.The court heard he raced in the Birmingham Athletic Games in February 2008 and the Surrey County Indoor Championships a month later.Thomas, who denied all the charges, was found guilty of seven counts of fraud by false representation after he submitted sick notes claiming he was unfit to work.He was cleared of three counts of fraud by false representation and one count of fraud by failing to disclose information relating to his athletics coaching.Speaking outside court, Richard Crawford, of Newham Council, said: ""We take it very seriously that the tax payers of Newham have been defrauded in this way.",Sprinter Matthew Thomas branded 'common criminal',0
"Slight rise in UK adult learners, survey suggests","There has been a slight rise in the number of adults in the UK taking part in learning, a survey suggests.A survey of 5,000 adults by the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education found 21% were involved in learning, up from a low in 2009 of 18%.Of those surveyed, 47% expected to take up a course in the next three years.More women (23%) than men (20%) were involved in learning and the older people were, the less likely they were to participate.Just 8% of those aged 75 and over and 10% of those aged 65 to 74 identified themselves as learners.A total of 58% of those aged 17 to 19, and 40% of those aged 20 to 24, not surprisingly, said they were engaged in some learning activity.The Niace survey of 4,964 adults aged 17 and over asked respondents to assess whether or not they identified themselves as a learner.The learning involved could be formal, qualifications, work-based, online or self-directed and covers a range of areas from academic subjects to recreational activities.The poll showed socio-economic class remained a key predictor of adult participation in learning.In the AB classes, 28% were involved in learning and 27% in the C1 category and 17% in the C2 group were involved in adult classes.But in the DE category, just 14% were engaged in learning. However, this was an improvement on participation rates in 2009, when 11% in this group were involved in education.The poll found 82% of those surveyed agreed that learning was ""enjoyable for its own sake"" and 77% agreed that learning as an adult had ""a positive impact on your child's chances at school"".Chief executive of Niace Alan Tuckett welcomed the increase in adult learners, saying there was ""a sea change in adults' engagement in learning"".He added: ""Perhaps the most striking result in the survey is the first statistically significant improvement in participation by adults from social class DE - the poorest cohort, comprising unemployed people, semi- and unskilled adults and retired people.  ""Yet just to maintain these gains will be challenging, when public finances are under so much pressure. Things may be moving in the right direction, but they have some way to go.""","Slight rise in UK adult learners, survey suggests",0
Marine firefighters evacuate fish factory ship,"A fish factory ship on fire for days off Cornwall's coast has been evacuated and the last five people on board flown to hospital after inhaling smoke.The Faroes-registered Athena caught fire about 230 miles (370km) south west of the Isles of Scilly on Wednesday and is now under tow off Falmouth.Nearly 30 firefighters and crew members on board were taken off after a release of carbon monoxide, coastguards said.About 650,000 cardboard boxes are believed to be on fire on board. The final four firefighters and the captain of a pilot boat were taken to the Royal Cornwall Hospital overnight suffering from the effects of breathing in smoke. The fire had been kept under control while the vessel sailed in from the Atlantic under its own power.Twelve Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service personnel specially trained in dealing with marine fires were airlifted on to the Athena by helicopter on Thursday.The group, and other specialists brought on board to assess the situation, joined 13 crew members who had remained on the vessel to tackle the fire.The fire started to get worse again from about 1700 BST on Thursday, Martin Bidmead from Falmouth Coastguard said.He said: ""A large release of carbon monoxide from somewhere on board this vessel caused the fire officer in charge on board make the decision that the vessel should be evacuated for the safety of the 28 persons on board.""The vessel has no power after heat from the fire affected the engine room. Coastguard tug Anglian Princess took it under tow at about 1900 BST. It is being kept about five miles (8km) outside Falmouth's harbour limits. A Dutch tug, the Typhoon, is also nearby. It was to spray water jets at the Athena in an attempt to cool the Athena's exterior, coastguards said. Decisions were also to be made later about whether it was safe to go back on board and fight the fire, they added.The Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention, Hugh Shaw, was due in Falmouth later to meet salvors and decide on the next move, Mr Bidmead said.Coastguards were alerted to the fire, which is believed to have started in a store, at about 0620 BST on Wednesday.A container ship, the Vega, rescued 98 of the 111-strong crew on Wednesday afternoon and arrived at Falmouth on Thursday. Tugs and tenders brought the crew ashore a few at a time. No-one was hurt in the fire or the evacuation of the vessel, but the Athena's skipper has been kept in hospital overnight suffering from exhaustion after his ordeal at sea.",Marine firefighters evacuate fish factory ship,0
US retail sales rise boosts recovery hopes,"US retail sales rose more than expected in April, helped by a surprise increase in motor vehicle sales.The Commerce Department said total retail sales rose by 0.4% following an upwardly revised 2.1% rise in March. Compared to April 2009, sales were 8.8% higher, and have now increased for seventh straight months.The figures have increased hope that consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of the US economy, will keep the recovery on track in coming months.""This adds to a string of data we have received indicating that consumer spending is improving,"" said James Cox, managing partner at Harris Financial Group in Virginia.Motor vehicle and parts purchases unexpectedly rose 0.5%, following a 6.7% increase in March.  Excluding this category, sales rose 0.4% in April after rising 1.2% in March.  US economic growth had initially had been largely driven by businesses replenishing inventories, but consumer spending grew in the first quarter at its fastest pace in three years.Meanwhile, another report on Friday - from the Federal Reserve - showed industrial production rose 0.8% in April, better than economists' prediction of 0.6%.It means manufacturing also appears to be playing a leading role in supporting the economic recovery.Stronger manufacturing has also seen factories increase hiring.Last week, manufacturers added 44,000 jobs in April, the most since 1998.Businesses that make fabricated metal products, machinery, electrical equipment and appliances, plastics, food, and paper products all posted job gains.",US retail sales rise boosts recovery hopes,0
Nissan returns to profit despite 'crisis mode',"Japanese carmaker Nissan has reported a return to annual profit after cutting fourth quarter losses.In the January to March period, losses shrank to 11.6bn yen ($125m; £0.8m) from 276.9bn yen a year ago, helped by cost-cutting and strong sales in China.It means Nissan returned to profit for the year, reporting an annual profit of 42.4bn yen, against 233.7bn last time.""Though we are still... in crisis mode, Nissan is well on track toward complete recovery,"" said president Carlos Ghosn.""A year ago I said Nissan knows how to adapt and face a crisis. Today you can see how we have progressed and where we are headed.""We will emerge from this crisis more competitive and stronger,"" said Mr Ghosn, who also heads Renault, which owns 44% of Nissan.Nissan is banking on the success in Europe and the US of its Leaf all-electric model, which the company hopes will be more attractive to buyers than petrol-electric hybrids offered by Toyota and Honda.Last month, Nissan and Renault announced a partnership with Germany's Daimler to share technology.Nissan sold 3.5 million vehicles in the year to 31 March. Sales were down in North America and Europe but recovered in Japan. In China, sales jumped 39% to 756,000 vehicles.   The company said it planned to sell about 3.8 million vehicles worldwide for the fiscal year to next March, up 8.1% on the previous year.Both Toyota and Honda have also reported improved profit figures for their fourth quarters, underlining a widespread view that the automotive industry is recovering from recession.",Nissan returns to profit despite 'crisis mode',0

Reward over 'sickening' shooting of Osprey in Sussex,"Police and the RSPB have offered a £1,000 reward to help catch the person who shot an Osprey in East Sussex.Sussex Police said the young bird, which was tagged in Sweden, was found at Holmes Hill, Golden Cross, with a gunshot wound to its wing.It was treated by a veterinary specialist but died during an operation.Mark Thomas, of the RSPB said: ""The shooting and subsequent death of this bird is sickening.""He added: ""Not only is it an amazing species but the fact it was born in Sweden and was passing through the UK on migration makes the killing a national disgrace"". Ch Insp Martin Sims, of Sussex Police, said: ""The protection offered to birds of prey by the law is clear and the police will enforce that legislation.""Ospreys are fully protected at all times across Europe and anyone convicted of this offence in the UK could face up to six months in prison.

Equitable Life: New compensation plan announced,"An enhanced compensation scheme for over one million Equitable Life members has been announced by the two parties forming the UK's coalition government.The savers lost money after the pension company's near-collapse in 2000.The coalition agreement says they will be compensated for their ""relative loss"", as recommended by the Parliamentary Ombudsman.This goes much further than the limited scheme being devised at the request of the former Labour government.After the Equitable closed to new business in 2000 more than a million policyholders suffered large cuts to the value of either their prospective or current pensions as the society struggled to stay solvent. Paul Weir, spokesman for the Equitable Members  Action Group, welcomed the new government's commitment.""After 10 years of denial and obstruction by the previous administration it's been a long time coming,"" he said. ""Sadly many thousands of Equitable pensioners have died without justice, sacrificed on the altar of Gordon Brown's defence of 'lite touch' regulation.""In a seven-page document, the Tories and Lib Dems have outlined the key issues on which they agree as part of a coalition government.Within it is a single paragraph that will be welcomed by campaigners who have called for fuller compensation for Equitable Life members.""We agree to implement the Parliamentary and Health Ombudsman's recommendation to make fair and transparent payments to Equitable Life policy holders, through an independent payment scheme, for their relative loss as a consequence of regulatory failure,"" it reads.Alistair Dunbar, of the Equitable, said: ""This does look very positive.""We look forward to working with the new government to help them to deliver a payment scheme that is swift, simple, transparent, fair and seen-to-be fair.  Our policyholders have been waiting long enough.""In July 2008 the Parliamentary Ombudsman, Ann Abraham, published a report which pinpointed ""a decade of regulatory failure"" as being one of the main reasons for the collapse of the pension company.  She called on the government to set up a scheme to compensate the savers for the maladministration and their losses.""The aim of such a scheme should be to put those people who have suffered a relative loss back into the position that they would have been in had maladministration not occurred,"" she said at the time.However, the Labour government proposed a less wide-ranging scheme.Last October, the High Court approved the government's plan for only limited payments to those who had lost money ""disproportionately"". A former High Court judge, Sir John Chadwick, has been trying to design a payment scheme to meet the government's aims, and his work has been ongoing until now.""I welcome the commitment the new government has made in its coalition agreement today to implement the recommendations I put forward for the compensation of Equitable Life policy holders,"" said Ms Abraham.Among the other key personal finance issues outlined in the coalition document are:Reductions to the Child Trust Fund and tax credits for higher earnersAn independent commission being set up to review the long term affordability of public sector pensions, while protecting accrued rightsRestoration of the earnings link for the basic state pension from April 2011 with a ""triple guarantee"" that pensions are raised by the higher of earnings, prices or 2.5%, as proposed by the Liberal DemocratsAn increase in the personal allowance for Income Tax from April 2011The phasing out of the default retirement ageA review to set the date at which the state pension age starts to rise to 66, although it will not be sooner than 2016 for men and 2020 for women.

Personal insolvencies at new high in England and Wales,"A new record high has been recorded for the number of people being declared insolvent in England and Wales.There were 35,682 personal insolvencies in the first three months of 2010, a 17.9% increase compared with the same period a year earlier.But the figure has levelled off compared with previous quarters, rising by only 108 individuals since the last three months of 2009.The number of companies going bust fell sharply, the figures show.In the first three months of the year, there were 1,343 receiverships, administrations or company voluntary arrangements - all forms of corporate insolvency. This was down 8% on the previous quarter and a fall of 25% on the same period a year earlier.The number of companies being liquidated - the end stage of the insolvency process - also dropped. There were 4,082, 8% fewer than the previous three months and 18% down on the same quarter a year earlier.This is the fifth consecutive quarter that the number of people being declared insolvent has reached a new high.As in late 2009, the record numbers were due in part to the number of people who have found themselves out of a job during the recession, but with debts to pay off. However, continued record low interest rates would have saved some people from insolvency, especially with mortgage costs remaining low.Although the number of personal insolvencies merely crept up, there was some variation in the ways in which people went insolvent, the figures show.There were 18,256 bankruptcies - the traditional way of dealing with overwhelming debt. This was down 10.7% on the same period the previous year, but up 7.3% on the previous quarter.The new style of dealing with relatively small debts - Debt Relief Orders (DROs) - grew again to 5,644.DROs are a new and cheaper form of insolvency procedure aimed at helping people wipe the slate clean if they have debts of less than £15,000 and few assets.The number of Individual Voluntary Arrangements (IVAs), which see people come to an official deal with their creditors, stood at 11,782.This was up 20.1% on the same period a year earlier, but at the lowest level since the first three months of 2009. This might be because job losses mean fewer people are able to afford regular repayments on their debts, forcing them to consider ""last resort"" options such as bankruptcy, rather than IVAs.""Many people who have been struggling with big debts and reduced income have managed to survive the past two years because of low interest rates. If interest rates had been any higher, the figures would have been considerably worse,"" said insolvency practitioner Alan Tomlinson.""When interest rates rise, and rising inflation suggests that this could happen sooner rather than later, the number of people facing real financial difficulties will spike sharply.""The levelling-off in individual insolvencies that we are seeing is therefore likely to be short-lived.""He said the economic decisions made in Westminster would have a key effect on the future direction of personal insolvencies.Chris Nutting, of accountants KPMG, said: ""If, as predicted, the new government raise taxes and reduce public sector spending, a lot of people will need to take drastic action to resolve their financial problems, such as applying for bankruptcy. ""The cost of filing your own petition in bankruptcy rose from £510 to £600 in April, but this does not seem to have caused any reduction in the number of people filing their own petitions.""""Whilst the UK is technically out of recession, the harsh reality is that many people are still living beyond their means. History shows that personal insolvencies will continue to rise for some time after the recession finally ends."" The number of personal insolvencies far outstrips the figures from the previous recession in 1992 and 1993.It is now far easier to go bankrupt and the levels of personal debt are much greater.On the corporate front, Mr Tomlinson said that this fall was likely to be short-lived too.""The number of company liquidations appears to have peaked and this is welcome in that it shows companies have become battle-hardened and are finding ways to survive,"" he said.""But the number of companies folding will almost certainly rise in the months ahead because of the lag effect.""Cash flow, a lack of lending from banks, suppliers paying late and HM Revenue and Customs calling in its debts had put companies under pressure, he added.""The business community needs political certainty and direction, but certainty and direction, for the time being at least, remain out of reach.""",Personal insolvencies at new high in England and Wales,0

Plants and spiders 'compete for the same food supply',"A study has shown how two species from different taxonomic kingdoms - animal and plant - compete for the same food.US researchers found examples where there was a high dietary overlap between pink sundews, a carnivorous plant, and wolf spiders.When food was scarce, the team found that the spiders built larger webs to improve their chances of catching prey, but at the expense of the plants.The results appear in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.""It does seem that the spiders can adapt quicker to the changes in food resources, ensuring that they maximise their chances of capturing prey,"" said co-author David Jennings, a researcher at the University of South Florida.""All the results that we have seen in the fieldwork were consistent with the idea that the spiders were changing different traits that they have in response to the presence of sundews,"" he told BBC News.""The field findings, combined with the lab study, all seem to indicate that competition is going on.""The fieldwork was carried out in wetlands habitats in Florida, where both pink sundews - a small plant with a ""rosette"" of leaves with a sticky substance at the end to trap prey - and funnel-web-building wolf spiders were found.The plants and spiders both adopted similar ""passive"" systems; traps that relied on sticky substances to capture their prey - arthropods, such as springtails, small flies and ants.To support the fieldwork, the researchers also carried out a laboratory experiment involving 40 glass tanks, each containing six sundew plants from soil collected from a nearby bog.The team then equally divided the tanks into five scenarios: spider and high food supply; spider and low food supply; no spider and high food supply; no spider and low food supply, and no spider and no food.The aim was to determine what impact factors, such as the presence of spiders and food availability, would have on the plants. ""Our laboratory results supported our... prediction that spider presence would reduce sundew fitness,"" the researchers wrote.They found that the spiders had a number of adverse effects on the plants, including a reduction in flower stalks and seeds being produced.""Our experiment demonstrated that [the spiders] can negatively affect sundew fitness by depriving them of nutrients normally obtained from prey. The researchers suggested that the study was the first to show that members of plant and animal kingdom in a terrestrial environment competing for the same food resources.David Jennings added that further research was planned to build on these findings: ""We would like to find out if the sundews are affecting the fitness of the spiders.""That's the key part of future research that we need to do.""",Plants and spiders 'compete for the same food supply',0
Demands of after-school life 'affect family time',"Middle-class parents feel pressured into offering their children ""every conceivable"" extra-curricular activity, a leading head teacher says.The chairman of the Independent Schools Association, Graham Gorton, says this can affect family time.He also bemoans a ""must-have"" culture that makes parents feel failures if they cannot buy their children the latest gadgets.And he warns against rules that stop children climbing trees.Mr Gorton is expected to tell Thursday's ISA conference in Bournemouth: ""Over recent decades we seem to have created a 'must-have' culture amongst our young people.""Many see that they may be perceived to be failing as parents if they do not ensure that their children have the latest gadgets and electronic devices along with their peers.""Many parents also, I suspect, feel pressured to enrol their offspring into every conceivable club or after-school activity that is available, including through the weekends.""This must have an impact on the very precious family time that exists.""Long gone, it seems, are those times when a whole weekend ahead with nothing planned was seen as a luxury and a perfect opportunity to spend time together and share those valuable and irreplaceable moments of childhood.""Many parents sign their children up for extra classes in the hope that they will not only get extra skills but boost their academic achievements. And research suggests that exam results are improved by wider experience of extra-curricular activities such as music and sports.Mr Gorton also calls for a common-sense approach to education and the bringing-up of children.""At my last school the pupils were allowed, and even actively encouraged, to climb trees within the grounds of the school.""They were told which ones were best to climb and how to climb safely, but were then 'left to explore' with adults close at hand but not prohibiting them from discovering their own limits and extending their climbing activities.""He says in the eight years that he was at a previous school there was one sprained ankle from a pupil who went a little too high up a tree.Children learn best by experience and by taking measured risks, he claims.But he suggests this is being jeopardised by health and safety legislation.",Demands of after-school life 'affect family time',0
BT expands super-fast broadband network,"BT has announced that it will expand its roll-out of next-generation broadband to bring super-fast services to two-thirds of the UK.Originally its fibre services, offering speeds of up to 40 megabits per second (Mbps), were due to reach around 40% of the population by 2012.A £1bn investment will see the project roll out to a further 20% of the population by 2015.The first four million people will be connected by the end of the year.""It's an exciting situation,"" said Liv Garfield of the firm.The firm has also announced a deal with the Onlive video games service to offer streaming games to BT Vision customers. ""You'll have many games from many different providers and you'll be able to play them wherever you are,"" said Ms Garfield.  The expansion of fibre services has been enabled by the firm's return to profit.  BT announced a profit of just over £1bn ($1.49bn) in the year to 31 March, compared with a loss of £244m during the previous 12 months. The telco had previously committed to spend £1.5bn on its fibre network by 2012 but is now able to invest a further £1bn, said Ms Garfield. She said of the 66% of the population who will have access to the fibre network, one quarter will have fibre to the home. ""That will have download speeds of 100 Mbps and uploads of 30 Mbps,"" she told BBC News. The rest will have ""fibre to the cabinet"", meaning that the fast cables will reach street side cabinets. This will offer download speeds of 40Mbps, said Ms Garfield. The roll out will be ""evenly distributed"" across England, Scotland and Wales, she said. Adrian Wooster at the Independent Networks Cooperative Association, which co-ordinates community broadband efforts, said it was only the start of the journey towards faster broadband for all.""This announcement to deliver up to 40 Mbps to much of the population provides the UK with an opportunity to re-camp and seriously consider how we as nation will be able to invest on the levels required to match the broadband programmes seen in other countries,"" he said.""We have left base camp and are making good progress but mustn't lose sight of the summit,"" he added.The Conservatives have made it clear that they do not support immediate government intervention in the broadband market. Before the election it said that if commercial firms have not provided super-fast broadband to everyone by 2012, it will consider offering some financial help.Many communities have become frustrated by the slow roll-out of fibre services and have begun to offer their own.Midlands village Lyddington broke away from BT after the telco said it was too expensive to offer fibre services.After successfully ""unbundling"" the Lyddington telephone cabinet, locally-based Rutland Telecom has had enquiries from 200 other villages keen to do the same thing.But, in order to establish how much it would cost each village to break away from BT it needs access to some crucial information about how homes are connected to its network.""BT has consistently refused to release the data Rutland Telecom needs to tell which premises are connected to which green cabinet,"" said Dr David Lewis.""It seems BT is not interested in delivering a rural solution but at the same time is trying to stop anyone else from doing so,"" he added.Ms Garfield said that she was unaware of any problems.""It's news to me I'm afraid. I thought we had provided everything we were required to provide."" ",BT expands super-fast broadband network,0
Sean Penn given community service over snapper spat,"Hollywood actor Sean Penn has been ordered to perform 300 hours of community service following a spat with a photographer. Penn, who was not in court, pleaded no contest to vandalism after being filmed attacking the paparazzo last year. He will also be subject to three years probation and have to undergo 36 hours of anger management counselling. Penn, 49, will be able to complete his community service working for his Haiti charity.He was originally charged with misdemeanour battery and vandalism, which could have led to an 18-month jail term.But the plea bargain saw the charges dropped to misdemeanour vandalism, which could again be reduced to disturbing the peace if he complies with the court's punishment.His lawyer, Richard Hirsch, said: ""Prolonging this matter in the court system would not have been in Mr Penn's best interests and would have  distracted from his charitable commitments, specifically his work in Haiti.""Accordingly he has decided to accept the terms and move on.""Penn, who won his second Oscar last year for Milk, was sentenced to 60 days in jail in 1987 after attacking a photographer on a film set. He was also involved in an altercation with a member of the paparazzi at the funeral of his brother Christopher in 2006.",Sean Penn given community service over snapper spat,0
Lawyer banned for authorising boiler room adverts,"A UK lawyer has been severely punished by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) for helping bogus Spanish share-selling firms, known as boiler rooms.Andrew Greystoke and his firm Atlantic Law have been fined £400,000 and he has been banned for life from the financial services industry.He authorised 50 letters for the boiler rooms between December 2005 and March 2007.The FSA said their activities led to at least 130 people in the UK losing at least £3m.However, the regulator believes that as they were just the victims who complained, there were probably many more people who would have lost much more money in total.""Atlantic Law and Andrew Greystoke acted recklessly, without integrity and with a complete disregard of the risks to consumers,"" said Margaret Cole, FSA director of enforcement and financial crime.""He did so without taking reasonable steps to ensure that the advertisements were clear, fair and not misleading and despite having reason to doubt that the Spanish firms would deal with UK consumers in an honest and reliable way,"" the FSA said.Instead of being sent free investment research as promised, the promotional letters were used to garner the telephone numbers of potential victims who could then be persuaded to buy dud shares.""The Spanish companies subjected UK consumers who requested the reports, which Greystoke knew to be of poor quality, to pressurised selling of high-risk illiquid shares in unlisted small companies,"" the FSA explained.  ""UK consumers who complained to the Spanish companies were subjected to threats and blackmail,"" it added. The FSA estimates that share frauds such as this cost UK investors about £200m a year.Last year it found 734 victims who lost an average £24,000 each.""Greystoke accepted before the tribunal that these Spanish firms were boiler room share scam operators,"" the FSA said.  ""Greystoke approved their advertisements despite seeing consumer complaints and press articles clearly warning of their activities and despite negative previous experience of acting for other Spanish boiler room clients,"" the regulator added.",Lawyer banned for authorising boiler room adverts,0
From Footlights to the first-timers,"It has been 29 years since the first ever Edinburgh comedy awards were handed out to a group of bright-eyed student members of the Cambridge Footlights.The unruly bunch of unknowns comprised a few names perhaps more recognisable nowadays, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Emma Thompson and Tony Slattery, to name but four.As organisers ready the list of nominees for the 30th award, we talk to three very different comedians at the break of their comedy careers.At the age of 19-years-old, Scottish comedian Daniel Sloss is already making a name for himself in British comedy. At the age of 16, he wrote jokes for Frankie Boyle on Mock The Week and did his first full show last year. This year, he turned down university to concentrate on his act. Sloss's new show My Generation takes a pop at older people as well as addressing the trials of living at home with his parents and younger brothers and sisters.You turn 20 next month and will no longer be a 'teenage comedian'. Does this mean your material will change completely?I will have to quit! No, but I've had a lot of reviewers saying: 'You do lots of jokes about being young,' but they don't say to women comedians: 'You do lots of jokes about being women'... I'm not playing on it, it's just what I know so, when I turn 20, I'll still be young but I won't be doing the teenage stuff. Were you viewed with suspicion last year because you were so young?It wasn't so much suspicion, it was more like when you walk out on stage, they look at you and go: 'Really? You're six, how could you possibly make us laugh?' They weren't expecting me to be any good, which made the gigs a bit easier. How do different ages react to you?Teenagers who come to comedy shows are normally picked on for being young, whereas when I come on, they can relate to it. Older people between 25 and 45, they have kids my age and they get the jokes. But the over 65s hate me. Everything I stand for is offensive, my existence is the worst thing that could have possibly happened. What would a best newcomer award nomination mean to you? For me, the award is given to a stand up who has a different look, has a different way of doing things. I'm just a normal stand up. I don't claim to change comedy, so a nomination would be lovely but it's never going to happen.Daniel Sloss: My Generation is on at the Pleasance Dome until 30 August.Another teenage comedian, 19-year-old Massachusetts-born Bo Burnham is nevertheless a very different performer. Mixing satirical songs with comedy haiku and intricate wordplay, Burnham became a YouTube sensation whose videos have had more than 60 million hits. His performances brought him to the attention of US comedy director Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, Superbad) who is now working on a film with him. Burnham's show Words, Words, Words marks his debut at the Edinburgh Fringe.How did you get started in comedy?I put some songs I'd recorded on YouTube, that I did when I was 16, and they built up a momentum. Then I started doing them live and started working on an act and I've been doing that for about two years now.Do you enjoy messing up an audience's expectations?When people hear about a 19-year-old singing comedian, they think it's just a kid singing about hooking up with girls and stuff. I like giving little back-handed swipes to all the people who write me off because of my age or what I do. It's more about constantly misdirecting people.Have you had any audiences that just didn't get it? Yeah, I had a show at an army academy. That didn't go well. Bombing is good and healthy and fun. It's good to have the struggle. If you just do okay, then you've lost them. But if you bomb, it's so much fun. You do jokes about Shakespeare, haiku and quantum mechanics. Do younger audiences get you?I'm a big nerdy dude. I have young audiences that are really nerdy and really cool. I try and mix it up so there is stuff for the kids. I had a parent come up and say: 'I don't approve of your material but if my son got all of your jokes, I'd be really happy.'What is the project you're working on with Judd Apatow?I'm writing a movie musical, I don't know if it's going to be made or not - but it's been really fun. I've been thinking about recording a rap album as well, so my stand up becomes more stand up and my music becomes more music. I have no five-year plan though.Bo Burnham: Words, Words, Words is on at the Pleasance Dome until 29 AugustAndi Osho is a 37-year-old Londoner who grew up in the East End to Nigerian parents. An actress and writer, she came to comedy later in her career. Her debut show Afroblighty plots her journey towards finding her own identity, taking in stereotypes, the BNP, political correctness and America's first black president.Is this your first full-length show?In 2007, I came up as an actor and did a Shakespeare for Breakfast thing which kicked off the whole festival. A couple of years ago I did some bits and pieces. but this is my debut doing a full hour-long show.You started out acting, so when did the comedy kick in?When I was acting on TV and stuff, I was always playing serious roles like police officers - telling people that their husbands had died. I guess it was a lack of acting work really. I always wanted to do this. I did a comedy course and then I did some gigs and now here I am, haemorrhaging cash in Edinburgh.Was it a steep learning curve?I was absolutely terrified the first time, I'll never forget it. I was standing backstage, and I was so nervous that I could barely speak. Then I had this sudden moment of calm. It must be like the moment they call your name before an execution. I thought 'I might as well just enjoy it,' and I did.  Are you aware of playing to audiences who, year after year, see a lot of comedy and will compare you with other comics?Yeah, but that always happens. I just come up here to improve as a comic. I'm already thinking  'What would I like to do next year, and how can I get better?'Andi Osho's Afroblighty is on at the Stand III &amp; IV until 29 August",From Footlights to the first-timers,0
BBC Two to screen Alex Higgins documentary,"Alex Higgins: The People's ChampionWednesday 1 September; BBC Two 2100-2200 BST Alex Higgins: The People's ChampionOne man transfixed television viewers more than any other during snooker's golden age - his name was Alex 'Hurricane' Higgins.This hour-long BBC Two documentary charts the remarkable rise and fall of snooker's first genius, from Alex's early days growing up in Belfast to the summit of the sport as two-time world champion, and back down again, as alcohol hastened his slide from grace and cancer ravaged his body.At his peak, Higgins was pure showbiz, a mercurial talent at the table who played the game like nobody had done before. Boxing had Muhammad Ali, football was blessed by George Best - snooker had Alex Higgins.Alex was - like so many geniuses - flawed. He may have been the sport's most popular star, but he struggled to cope with the demons of alcohol and gambling.We chart the depressing lows: the alcohol abuse; threatening to have fellow Ulsterman Dennis Taylor shot; headbutting a senior member of snooker's hierarchy; and falling out of a top floor window after a row with his then girlfriend.ExclusiveThe archive is astonishing, the stories often heart-breaking but the snooker is always breathtaking.We hear from those closest to Higgins, including an exclusive interview with his daughter Lauren and his sisters Jean and Anne. And we complete the Higgins story for the first time in a major documentary with the final chapter of his life spent battling throat cancer. The desperate hours spent in pubs and clubs trying to rekindle his halcyon days; his reliance on baby food after being unable to eat properly because he had lost his teeth; and his sad death in sheltered accommodation.At times uplifting, but at other moments very sad - this is a rollercoaster journey charting the life of snooker's first 'rock and roll star'.The programme is poignantly timed just weeks after Alex's funeral and shortly before the World Open heralds the start of the new snooker season.Contributors from the green baize include Higgins' great friend Jimmy White, old adversaries Dennis Taylor, Steve Davis and Ray Reardon and arguably the most talented player since 'the Hurricane', Ronnie O'Sullivan.",BBC Two to screen Alex Higgins documentary,0
Pakistan cricketer Mohammad Asif dropped from film,"Pakistani cricketer Mohammad Asif, who is under scrutiny for claims of spot-fixing, has been dropped from an Indian movie, its director has told the BBC.Kaithapram Damodaran Namboodiri said he had hired Asif for his directorial debut, Mazhavillilinattamvare (Till the edge of the rainbow).Asif was to play a Pakistani cricketer who comes to a coaching camp in the southern Indian state of Kerala.The film is about friendship told through the game of cricket, he said.Mr Namboodiri said he had signed up the bowler two months ago after his son conducted a screen test with the cricketer in London.""He is a friendly and nice guy. I was shocked to hear about the allegations, so I dropped him from the film,"" said Mr Namboodiri.The director said Asif was supposed to come down to Kerala for a 25-day shooting stint next month.The 27-year-old had been set for a ""major part"" in the film, which is to be made in the Malayalam language, spoken in Kerala.""He was to play a Pakistani cricketer who comes down to India to hold a coaching camp for Indian players,"" said Mr Namboodiri.The director added he had initially contacted former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram to play the role, but he had declined.He said he was now seeking a replacement for Asif: ""I have the names of two or three Pakistani cricketers in my mind.""Asif, along with team mates Salman Butt, Mohammad Amir and Kamran Akmal, have all been questioned by police over claims of spot fixing during Pakistan's ongoing tour of England, although wicketkeeper Akmal is no longer under investigation.

"Bankruptcies to keep on rising, figures suggest","The number of people trying to have themselves declared bankrupt in England and Wales rebounded in the first three months of the year.Ministry of Justice figures show the number of bankruptcy petitions lodged in the courts by debtors rose 20% from the previous three months, to 16,348.Bankruptcy proceedings started by creditors also rebounded, up by 4% to 4,329.The figures suggest eventual bankruptcies will continue rising.There is a a seasonal element to the statistics, as well as ""debt lag"", explained Brian Johnson, an insolvency practitioner at accountants HW Fisher.""People who have been fighting to stay afloat for the past two years are increasingly throwing in the towel, as they simply can't go on any longer,"" he said.""For many people, the current downturn has lasted for too long and more and more of them are now having to declare themselves bankrupt.""There is often a rise in the number of debtors' bankruptcy petitions in the first quarter, as people make a huge effort to get beyond Christmas before they concede defeat.""Last week, the Insolvency Service reported that the number of people being declared insolvent in England and Wales had hit a new record in the first quarter of 2010.There were 35,682 personal insolvencies in that time, an 18% rise from the same period a year earlier, though just 108 more than in the previous quarter.The overall figures reflected the number of actual bankruptcies, which had risen 7% from the previous three months.They also reflected the number of people going through the alternative routes to insolvency - individual voluntary arrangements (IVAs) and the newer debt relief orders.The MoJ figures show that while the number of bankruptcy petitions being lodged by creditors has been fairly steady over the past five years, at about 20,000 a year, the number of bankruptcies being instigated by the people in debt has been shooting up.In 2005 there were 37,000, but by last year they had risen to 63,000.The number of requests lodged with the courts to wind up a company - either by a shareholder, director or creditor - also rose in the first quarter.The number of these winding up petitions stood at 2,777, a 4% rise on the last three months of 2009.However, they are not a complete indicator of how many companies are in danger of going bust.Some petitions might be unsuccessful, for instance if a company's directors can convince the court that their firm is in fact solvent or has the prospect of being so.Also, as the Insolvency Service statistics highlighted last week, being wound up compulsorily is just one possible outcome for a firm that is in danger of going bust.Insolvent companies may be rescued by reaching a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) with their creditors, or by going into administration, thus avoiding being wound up as a result of a court petition.","Bankruptcies to keep on rising, figures suggest",0
Wedgwood museum hit by pension debt black hole,"Valuable artefacts from the Wedgwood museum in Stoke-on-Trent could be seized by creditors because of a pension fund black hole.Staffordshire-based pottery firm Waterford Wedgwood went into administration last year, with parts of the business later bought by a US firm. But it was the Wedgwood Museum Trust that inherited the £134m pension debt of the whole company.Forced into administration, the trust's exhibits could be claimed by creditors. The £10.5m Wedgwood Museum in Barlaston opened in 2008 and is home to an exhibition of more than 250 years of the company's history and last year won the prestigious Art Fund Prize.Five of the museum trust's staff were in the same pension scheme as the employees of the whole pottery company.As the last solvent entity employing members of the scheme, the museum has been forced to take on the £134m pension debt that was left when Waterford Wedgwood collapsed. Joint administrator Steve Currie, from Begbies Traynor, said the museum would stay open for the foreseeable future. ""It's a really good museum and we're glad it's still there,"" he said. ""The question is whether the assets are held in trust by the museum or whether they're available for creditors. ""Once we know the answer to this we can exit administration via some kind of voluntary agreement.""The museum's closure would be a big loss for the region's tourist industry, according to Staffordshire historian Steve Birks.""All that social history would be split up, even though it's taken 250 years to collect,"" he said. ""It's a shame that the museum got a £1,000 prize last year for being so good, and has now been awarded a £134m debt"".The Trust said it is in talks about preserving its collection and that it is determined to ensure the museum's survival.""The Trustees are extremely grateful for the continued support of the museum's staff and its many friends, and remain optimistic that the collections will continue to be available to the public in our museum,"" said George Stonier, chairman.Wedgwood was founded in 1759, but Waterford Wedgwood was created in 1987 when it merged with the well-known Irish brand Waterford Crystal. It went into administration in January 2009 after being badly hit by the economic slowdown. The company also had debts of some £400m and a hole in its pension fund.A couple of months later the viable parts of the firm were bought by an American private equity firm, KPS Capital Partners, saving many jobs in the company - which was renamed WWRD Holdings. The Wedgwood Museum is in Wedgwood Drive, Barlaston, Stoke-on-Trent ST12 9ER and is open 9am-5pm Mon-Fri and 10am-5pm Sat &amp; Sun. ",Wedgwood museum hit by pension debt black hole,0
Pound falls as UK trade deficit widens,"The pound fell sharply against other major currencies following news that the UK's trade deficit has widened.The pound fell nearly two cents, or 1.2%, against the dollar at $1.4646, and by a cent against the euro.Earlier, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that gap between the UK's imports and exports widened last month.The value of imports exceeded exports by £3.7bn ($5.5bn), up from £2.2bn gap recorded in February.The ONS said the swings in the gap had been exacerbated by January's bad weather.That delayed the export of some goods until February, which helped to flatter that month's figure. Even so, the gap was also worse than in March last year.Exports crept up by just 1%, whereas imports rose by 5.2%. Although the falling pound suggests reduced confidence in the UK economy, it will also help exporters by making UK goods cheaper for foreign buyers. The pound fell against the euro to 1.1650, and was also down against the Japanese yen, and a range of other foreign currencies. On Wednesday, the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, said the UK's economy should shift its weight towards exports, rather than relying on domestic consumption.Economic experts expressed concern over rising trade deficit. Ross Walker, UK economist at RBS, said: ""These are disappointing numbers. I'm sceptical we're going to see any significant contribution to growth this year from net trade.""He said the worsening picture was particularly worrying, given the value of the pound: ""The much-needed rebalancing is not happening as quickly as we would have hoped, especially given the weakness in sterling.""The rise in imports was broad-based and driven by a jump in imports of intermediate goods such as mechanical and electrical engineering components, as well as cars, chemicals and oil.Exports of chemicals, which helped to shrink February's gap, fell sharply on the month.Vicky Redwood, economist at Capital Economics, said the numbers were bad for the future of the economy: ""Recent events in the euro-zone - the UK's biggest trading partner - clearly cast a shadow over the longer-term prospects for UK exporters.""

EADS sees quarterly profits fall,"European aerospace group EADS, the parent company of Airbus, has seen a 39% fall in quarterly profits.Net profit for the January to March quarter fell to 103m euros ($129m; £86m) from 170m euros a year ago. The figures included a profit of 7m euros for the Airbus commercial planemaking unit, from 89m a year earlier.The firm also said it had faced ""challenges"" at its A380 superjumbo programme.""In addition, the A380 continues to weigh significantly on underlying performance,"" EADS said in a statement.Airbus is struggling to increase production of the A380, the first of which was delivered almost two years late to Singapore Airlines in 2007.It has also struggled to contain costs because of the high level of customisation on the large airliner.Earlier this week, Airbus doubled its target for 2010 sales of its A380 superjumbo to more than 20, pointing to a  rebound in passenger traffic.Meanwhile, revenue fell 6% to 9bn euros in the period, from 8.5bn in the first quarter a year ago.But EADS chief executive Louis Gallois said the recent strengthening of the dollar was good news for the company, which sells planes in dollars, but has most of its costs in euros.""EADS should benefit in the mid- and long-term if the dollar trend is confirmed,"" he said in a statement.And, overall, Mr Gallois was ""cautiously optimistic that our industry is slowly on its way back up"", despite market turmoil showing ""the crisis is not yet fully behind us"".EADS is making a solo bid for a $35bn contract to build a new fleet of US military air refuelling tankers.The firm and US partner Northrop Grumman had abandoned their planned bid for the deal in March, saying the process was biased against them. They had argued that the terms of the tender favoured US group Boeing. EADS re-entered the race after the US government extended the bid deadline, and it now has until mid-July to make a bid.

Is the US stimulus package working,"European Union governments and the International Monetary agreed on a 75bn euro rescue package to prevent a debt crisis from spreading across Europe.But is it sensible for governments to intervene in the market place?Fifteen months after an economic stimulus package was put in place in the US there is much disagreement about whether it has achieved its aim.In February 2009, Congress in Washington approved tax cuts and spending of $787bn (£533bn) to prop up the US economy because companies and people had stopped spending money themselves.Professor Laura Tyson of Berkeley, who chaired [former] President Bill Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and now advises President Barack Obama, says the stimulus and the support for housing ""took a catastrophic situation and made it much less bad"".""When private sector demand is collapsing, investors are not investing and consumers have lost their jobs and the value of their house so they are not consuming"", she says.""So basically the government comes in and puts some demand into the system - that is what stimulus is - that is the logic.""Professor John Taylor of Stanford University says the stimulus package has not made much difference.""Looking at the specifics we can't find much evidence that it has worked at all,"" he says. ""What has happened would have happened anyway.""He maintains that there has been a good turn-around of growth.""It was minus 6% and now it is plus 6% - but almost all that is due to changes in investment, changes in inventory behaviour, and little to do with government purchases.""That does not necessarily mean that the money has been wasted.""Stanford University got some money to help research - but that is not the kind of thing that creates jobs or gets the economy moving again,"" he asserts.""The stimulus package in the US had very little road building - it was more the transfer payments to individuals, so the reality is [that] of the $787bn, only about $21bn was for infrastructure building in the first year,"" he says.California received $50bn. Some $197m of that was to build a fourth road tunnel through the hills above Berkeley. The condition was that projects had to be ready to go - shovel ready, in common parlance, and the project has been a relief for workers.""Before the crash we had to go looking for workers - now men turn up every day looking for work,"" says Jeff Weiss, one of the managers on the tunnel scheme. ""We are grateful for the money because it looked like the project was going to be delayed,"" he says.The tunnel will create about 4,500 jobs both directly with people working on the project itself and indirectly, such as the suppliers of steel and concrete, or the motels who put up the workers.Critics of the stimulus package say it provides too few jobs for too much money. But the calculation is complicated because it is not just about jobs. Local people also got a new tunnel and an easier commute.California has been allocated $50bn and the Republican governor, Arnold Schwazzenegger, appointed the Democrat Laura Chick as Inspector General, Federal American Recovery Act Funds, to keep track of the stimulus money.The governor said he did not want a single dollar wasted or sent back to Washington, ""We do not do audits because they would take too long, but I have two strike forces and these teams are following the money literally on the street,"" says Laura Chick.""We have put the fear of God in any fraudster types who were sitting there rubbing their hands saying 'wow here comes all that government money and I'm going to take advantage of it',"" she says.The FBI told her she could expect between 7-10% fraud and that after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans there was 17% fraud. ""What we have found is predominantly book-keeping and accounting issues,"" she says.""Something called the Work Investment Board got millions of dollars to give work experience and employment opportunities to at-risk youth who live in low income neighbourhoods where there is little summer activity,"" she explains.""We found that $1m was claimed for rent and overheads whereas the appropriate amount was $60,000. ""They are re-programming the balance back into the summer youth programme,"" she says.The hope now is that the private sector is strong enough to provide the missing spending. ""I would say there are two risks to that,"" maintains Ms Chick.""There are going to be significant lay offs by the state governments because they don't have the revenues to keep teachers hired, to keep people on environmental protection or railroads for example, so state employees will go down,"" she believes.""And the other thing is housing - there is still a lot of uncertainty about whether the erosion in housing values has stopped and whether therefore there is going to be a hiccup in the sales and even in construction industry by the end of the year.""When the stimulus money runs out there may be a need for more. The snag is, more taxpayer help will be hard to come by politically. ",Is the US stimulus package working,0
Spanish airline Iberia trims its losses," Spanish airline Iberia, which is merging with British Airways (BA), has reduced its quarterly losses by 44% after a rise in its passenger revenues.Also helped by cost-cutting work, its net loss for the January to March period was 52m euros ($65m; £45m).Iberia's revenues per passenger rose by 3.7% from a year earlier and it trimmed its workforce by 5.2%.BA and Iberia signed a deal to merge last month, expecting it to be completed by the end of this year.They hope that the merger will save the two airlines a combined 400m euros a year.The new company will be called International Airlines Group, but the BA and Iberia brands will continue to operate as normal.BA shareholders will own 55% of the business, which will have its headquarters in London.The world's airlines lost a collective $9.4bn (£6.5bn) last year, as customers reduced air travel during the recession, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).IATA expects this loss to narrow to $2.8bn this year, as the sector slowly recovers.",Spanish airline Iberia trims its losses,0
Muslim designers mix the hijab with latest fashions,"How do you combine Western fashion with a Muslim dress code?Fashion is a form of self-expression. It's all about experimenting with looks and, in many cases, attracting attention. The Islamic headscarf, or hijab, is exactly the opposite. It's about modesty and attracting as little attention as possible.However, a growing number of Muslim women are successfully blending the two. They get inspiration from the catwalk, the high street and fashion magazines, and they give it a hijab-friendly twist - making sure that everything except the face and hands are covered.They are known as Hijabistas.Jana Kossiabati is editor of the blog Hijab Style, which gets as many as 2,300 visits a day from across the world, including Africa, Middle East and the United States. ""I started two-and-a-half years ago,"" says Jana, who is British of Lebanese origin.""I'd seen so many fashion blogs and so many Muslim blogs but hadn't seen anything specifically dedicated to the way Muslim women dress. ""I started my own site to bring together elements of what Muslim women are looking for and to make mainstream fashion wearable and relevant to them.""Jana says one of the reasons why so many young Muslim women are reading hijab fashion blogs is that the Muslim fashion industry is lacking inspiration. ""I get comments on my blog from people saying that the clothes offered to Muslim women are too Islamic looking - they look very ethnic, very foreign,"" says Jana. ""Young Muslims are increasingly looking for fashion that doesn't set them apart from the rest of society.""According to Jana, events such as 9/11 and 7/7 also had an effect on fashion-conscious Muslim women.""Our generation became more aware of their identity when were thrust into the limelight after 9/11 and 7/7 and other events of the past decade or so. We were forced to deal with people questioning our faith, our identity and the way we look.""This may have prompted some women to choose to wear the hijab - but it also increased the urge among many young hijab-wearing women to fit in.Hana Tajima Simpson is a fashion designer who converted to Islam five years ago.In the beginning, she found it very hard to find her own style while following hijab rules.""I lost a lot of my personality through wearing the hijab at first. I wanted to stick to one mould and look a certain way,"" says Hana, who  comes from a British and Japanese background.""There was a certain idea I had in my head about how a Muslim woman should look which is the black Abaya (baggy dress and scarf), but I realised that this is not true and that I could experiment with my looks, while being modest.""It took a lot of trial and error to a find a style and a look I'm happy with."" Hana regularly blogs about her designs at Style Covered. While all her clothes are suitable for women who wear the hijab, she says she doesn't design with a specific group of people in mind.""Frankly I design for myself.""I think about what I'd like to wear and design it. I have many non-Muslim customers as well, so my designs are not targeted at Muslims alone.""Designer Sarah Elenany's clothes are quite different from Hana's - more urban and sporty. Islamic prints feature heavily on almost all of her outfits, including images of minarets and hands being extended to the heavens in prayer. They are religious, but far from traditional.""My label is a celebration of Islamic culture and art and it's not apologetic. It says' this is it, this is us.

Stock markets climb on European deficit plans,"European stocks have risen following Spanish and Portuguese plans to cut their budget deficits, easing worries that Europe's debt crisis could spread.The UK's main FTSE index closed up 0.9% on Thursday, while Germany's Dax added 1.1%. France's Cac finished flat.Asian shares had earlier posted rises, with Japan's Nikkei 225 adding 2.2%.US shares were however lower in morning trading following weak American job creation figures.Wall Street's main Dow Jones index was down 0.2%.On Wednesday, Spain revealed measures to save billions of euros.Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said they would save the country 15bn euros ($19bn; £12.5bn) over two years.Spain's budget deficit currently stands at 11% of GDP, and the austerity measures are designed to reduce this to 6% by 2011.""The eurozone problems had really weighed on the market, and reassurance after the Spanish announcement has allowed investors to turn their eyes to things like earnings and economic indicators for the first time in days,"" said Toshiyuki Kanayama at Monex.In an attempt to further appease the markets, Portugal has announced its own new austerity measures, pledging to raise income tax by between 1% and 1.5%. A tax on goods sold, meanwhile, will rise to 21% in an effort to raise government income and reduce Portugal's dependence on borrowing. Salaries of politicians and public sector chiefs are to be cut by 5%. The Spanish and Portuguese measures have given some indication that countries with high deficits are prepared to tackle the root of Europe's debt problems - over-spending.This is what investors want to see, analysts say, rather than countries simply relying on loan-guarantees from the European Union (EU) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).Last weekend, the EU and IMF agreed a 750bn-euro rescue package to prop up European economies struggling with large debts. This was designed to allay concerns that Greece's debt crisis might spread to other countries with high budget deficits, particularly Spain and Portugal.In a television interview, one senior European banker expressed doubts over Greece's ability to push through austerity measures and repay its debts.Josef Ackermann, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, told German television that the success of the Greek austerity measures required ""unbelievable efforts"" from the Greek people. He was more upbeat about Italy and Spain, saying they were ""strong enough to service their debt"", but said the situation in Portugal was ""more difficult"".

Snow Patrol and REM join forces,"Snow Patrol frontman Gary Lightbody has teamed up with REM guitarist Peter Buck and a host of A-list musicians to record a country concept album.Working under the name Tired Pony, the band's album includes contributions from actress Zooey Deschanel and Tom Smith from rock group The Editors.Lightbody described the record - called The Place We Ran From - as a ""twisted love letter to the States"".He added that the band would play a concert in London to support the album.""We just wanted to do a gig as soon as possible, to let people see that it was a proper band, not just this odd floating idea,"" Lightbody told BBC 6 Music.""It seemed crazy to do something as good as this record is and just walk away from it,"" added Buck. ""There'll hopefully be some shows and maybe another record.""The Tired Pony project came together after Lightbody sketched ideas for  a country album in a notebook during Snow Patrol's 2009 world tour.""I can't get away with writing pure country music because I haven't lived that life,"" he explained, ""but I love it so much that I always wanted to try my hand at it.""""It's inspired by my love of Wilco, Calexico, Lambchop, Palace, Smog - these bands that look at the darkness in America.""The singer said he had initially intended to record the album with friends, including Snow Patrol's guitar technician Troy Stewart (who appears on the finished record) but producer Garrett ""Jacknife"" Lee suggested recruiting Buck after working with REM.""That was the icing on the cake for me,"" Lightbody said ""because I'm such a fan.""Buck said he had ""no idea what was going to happen"" when he entered the recording studio, but the band gelled ""by the second day"".""Gary would just play a song, then [we would] immediately go out play it once, or maybe twice, and then it was done. ""I didn't even know Gary was considering it as 'a band' until it was nearly finished.""""Nobody really stuck to one instrument,"" added Lightbody, ""so you can't say, 'he's the lead guitarist' because he played bass and keyboards as well."" ""In fact, everybody did.""The Place We Ran From will be released on 12 July by Fiction records.

VAT 'will rise' under coalition government,"VAT is set to rise under the new coalition government, according to a BBC survey of influential economists. Of 28 independent economists currently used by the Treasury to assist its forecasts, 24 said they expected the rate to rise in the coming parliament.The majority predicted a rise from the current 17.5% to 20% before the end of 2011. Analysts say a 20% rate would raise an estimated £11.5bn a year.VAT was temporarily cut last year to 15% to aid the economic recovery. But the tax on consumer goods is seen as an attractive way to boost the government's tax income, with cutting the country's budget deficit a priority for the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition. On Wednesday the coalition said it wanted to see ""a significantly accelerated reduction"" in the country's borrowing, with £6bn of cuts planned in the first year. Any changes to VAT and other taxes are likely to be unveiled in an emergency Budget to be announced within 50 days. Economist Azad Zangana, from Schroders, who is predicting a rise in VAT to 19%, said that the UK economy is probably strong enough to withstand the expected cuts and tax rises. ""While earlier cuts in public spending are inevitably going to dampen economic growth, the UK recovery appears to be gathering pace,"" he said. He added, however, that £6bn in public spending cuts were only ""a drop in the ocean"" compared to what would be required to tackle the current £166bn deficit.Speaking to the BBC the chief executive of Sainsbury's, Justin King, admitted that a rise in VAT looked ""more likely than not"".But he said any rise had to be well-timed by the government, in order to minimise the impact on retailers.""If it is to go up from the 17.5% rate, let's get good advance notice of that and then have stability for the longer term,"" he said. ""It's a very complex and costly thing to do for retailers to change the rate of VAT.""",VAT 'will rise' under coalition government,0

Rating agencies face new US regulation,"The US senate has voted to tighten up regulation of credit rating agencies as part of measures to prevent another financial crisis.Under the proposals, US regulators will be in charge of deciding which rating agencies should rate products from different bank.Currently three rating agencies - Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch - dominate the industry. They have previously faced strong criticism from senators. In April a senate committee investigation concluded that the agencies should ""share the blame"" for the financial crisis and the economic problems that followed.They argued that the agencies had allowed banks to sell high-risk financial products with low-risk ratings. Senators are also concerned that the current rules allowing banks to high rating agencies directly make them more likely to produce favourable ratings for their products. The senate is currently debating new legislation designed to overhaul financial regulation in the US, in order to prevent a repeat of the banking crisis. The plans for tigher regulation come amid reports that several major Wall Street banks are being investigated by New York's attorney general over whether they misled rating agencies over mortgage-related deals in the run-up to the crisis. There is also speculation that US prosecutors are also investigating several big-name banks over suggestions they may have misled investors. Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates US banking, charged Goldman Sachs with civil fraud over the way it marketed its subprime mortgage products prior to the crisis. The spread of high-risk ""toxic"" loans through the banking sector - widely rated as safe by the agencies - sparked the credit crunch in the banking sector. Bank shares on Wall Street fell on Thursday amid the speculation. ",Rating agencies face new US regulation,0
Gove spells out education priorities for 'a new era',"Michael Gove has set out his priorities for education, saying they will mark a new era. The new Education Secretary confirmed that Conservative plans for ""free"" schools and more academies would be the focus for change. He said nothing was more important to the fairness of society and the country's future prosperity than getting education right.Lib Dem Sarah Teather and Tory Nick Gibb were named education ministers.The department has been renamed the Department for Education and Mr Gove has written to its civil servants setting out his priorities.He said it would be re-focused on ""supporting teaching and learning"".There will be no change to the areas which are covered by the department however and it will still include children's services. Previously, it was called the ""Department for Children, Schools and Families"".Mr Gove set out the priorities, saying: ""I believe, nothing is more important to the fairness of our society and the future prosperity of our country than getting education right.""Too many children still leave primary school every year without meeting basic standards in English or maths and too few 16-year-olds get five decent GCSEs. ""So improving literacy, raising pupil attainment, extending parental choice, freeing teachers from bureaucracy, improving discipline and closing the widening gap between the richest and the poorest should be our shared goal.""Mr Gove confirmed he intended to move quickly on plans for all schools to be given the freedom to become academies - schools which are funded by the state but are largely independent.""In the weeks ahead, I want us to offer all schools the chance to enjoy academy-style freedoms so that heads and teachers across the country can be liberated,"" he wrote. ""This will be the focus of the legislation we hope to bring forward later this month.""The Conservatives had pledged to have legislation in place so that schools could become academies by this September.The Liberal Democrats are also in favour of schools having more freedom, but there was a difference between the two parties in terms of how free such schools should be.The Liberal Democrats had previously said they wanted academies to come under local authorities while the Conservatives said they should be independent.The new government also wants to make it easier for groups of parents, charities and teachers to start schools.Mr Gove's letter confirmed those plans and said that this new generation of schools could have smaller class sizes - a key priority for the Lib Dems.""We will also work to allow charities, parents and teachers' groups to open a new generation of small schools with smaller class sizes,"" his letter said.Another key priority confirmed is that of the ""pupil premium"" - where funding is targeted to the most deprived pupils. This is something both the Conservatives and the Lib Dems had campaigned on  in the run up to the general election -  but had disagreed bitterly in terms of how it should be funded.The Liberal Democrats had promised £2.5 billion to pay for it.Other key priorities confirmed by Mr Gove were to:  give schools greater freedom over the curriculum ""radically reform exam system"" so that all schools can offer a wider range of qualifications support teachers by giving them more powers ""to ensure higher standards of discipline""",Gove spells out education priorities for 'a new era',0
PPI sale ban set for go-ahead,"Plans to restrict the sale of the controversial payment protection insurance (PPI) look set to go ahead.The Competition Commission wants to ban PPI being sold at the time loans are granted.It said customers would benefit from being given time to find more appropriate and better-value cover.PPI is supposed to enable borrowers to pay off loans such as credit card bills or mortgages if they fall ill or lose their job.The commission's decision is still provisional and open to final consultation - with a final verdict to be published in July.Plans to restrict PPI sales were first released in January last year.However, after an objection by Barclays, the Competition Appeal Tribunal asked the commission to review the plans - especially whether they would inconvenience customers who could not buy PPI at the same time as taking out a loan.Its further study found that ""many customers would place very significant value on being given the time and space to choose the right PPI product - or indeed to decide that PPI is not right for them"", said commission deputy chairman, Peter Davis.A ""significant"" number of customers appreciated the convenience of buying PPI at the point of sale of credit, he added.""Overall we concluded that PPI providers are overstating the loss of convenience that would result from the introduction of a prohibition on selling PPI during the credit sale.""Under the commission's proposals, the ban would not apply to protection taken out on repayments for shopping through home catalogues, which makes up about 2.5% of the PPI market.Barclays, whose complaint was supported by Lloyds Banking Group and Shop Direct Group Financial Services Ltd, said it was disappointed with the Commission's decision.""We know that PPI is a product that is of value to many people. In these times of economic uncertainty, adequate financial protection is more important than ever,"" a Barclays spokeswoman said.   ""We still maintain that to prohibit PPI being sold at the point of credit sale and for a fixed period afterwards will limit, rather than enhance, customer options and will result in customers being exposed as unprotected.""Consumer organisations have complained for some years about people being mis-sold PPI polices.Actions already taken by authorities include:In October last year, mortgage lenders and insurers agreed to refund £60m to customers whose premiums for mortgage payment protection insurance went up in 2009In September 2009, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) told banks and other lenders to compensate customers who may have been mis-sold payment protection insurance when selling ""single-premium"" PPI policies alongside unsecured personal loansAt the same time, all financial firms were told to reopen 185,000 old complaints about PPI they had previously dismissedIn May last year, the FSA told the banks, and other lenders who sell PPI, to immediately stop selling one version of the insurance, called single premium PPI, where the premiums are added onto the loan as an upfront lump sum.The sale of PPI has been called a ""protection racket"" by consumer groups, as the policies can be very expensive and have been mis-sold to people who could never make a valid claim under the terms of their policies.As part of its initial inquiries which led to the proposed ban, the Competition Commission found that in 2006, lenders made excess profits of £1.4bn when selling the insurance.It found that the vast majority of the UK's 12 million PPI policies were sold at the same time as a consumer took out a loan, credit card or other type of credit. Many consumers were unaware that they could buy PPI from other providers, rarely shopped around to compare prices and terms and conditions of PPI policies, and rarely switched PPI providers.Peter Vicary-Smith, chief executive of the consumers' association Which?, said: ""People need to protect their finances but PPI has been widely discredited because of its expense and the poor cover it offers.""The industry should now concentrate its efforts on developing protection products that offer better cover and value for money to its customers.""",PPI sale ban set for go-ahead,0
